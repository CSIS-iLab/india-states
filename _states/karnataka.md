Karnataka--and particularly its capital, Bangalore--shot to prominence in the 1990s as the home of India's burgeoning IT industry. While Bangalore now faces steeper competition for the title of India's "Silicon Valley," it is still one of the most important destinations for foreign and domestic investment in India. Karnataka has also successfully built hubs in the aerospace and biotech industries, although its government is not known for aggressive reforms.
