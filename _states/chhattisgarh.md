Chhattisgarh is a mineral-rich state with abundant coal and iron ore resources whose coal production makes it energy surplus; but it is also one of India's poorest states, with a poverty rate of 40 percent and low human development indicators. Long plagued by left-wing violence, with which it still struggles, Chhattisgarh's government is trying to diversify the state's economy by making it an attractive destination for non-extractive industries.
