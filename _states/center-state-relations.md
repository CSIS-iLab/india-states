Rather than collecting news on a certain state, this section tracks developments in the complex relationship between the central government and the states. The contours of Indian federalism are constantly in flux, as the center and states give up and power on certain issues or seek to regain it. This section contains news and analysis reflecting that push and pull, as well as news about developments that effect an entire region rather than just a single state.
