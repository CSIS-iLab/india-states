Jammu & Kashmir is best known for the decade-long insurgency that has marred upland Kashmir's chances for development. The state's special status under the Indian Constitution means it can reject many of the center's reform-minded economic legislation, meaning that business conditions here may be quite different than in the rest of the country. Poor connectivity to the rest of India and mountainous terrain that makes even habitation impossible in some areas don't help. As a result, Jammu & Kashmir is largely agriculture-dependent, although the lowland Jammu region has had more success at building industry.
