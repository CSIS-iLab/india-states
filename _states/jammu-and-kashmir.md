Jammu & Kashmir is best known for the decade-long insurgency that has marred upland Kashmir’s chances for development. The state’s special status under the Indian Constitution means it can reject many of the center’s reform-minded economic legislation, meaning that business conditions here may be quite different than in the rest of the country. Successive state and central governments have prioritized infrastructure development in the state to improve connectivity amongst its three regions of Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh and to better integrate it with the rest of India.  Jammu & Kashmir is largely dependent on agriculture, handicrafts and tourism, although the lowland Jammu region has had more success at building industry.
