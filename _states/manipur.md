One of India's isolated northeastern states, Manipur shares a long and rugged border with Myanmar and is a key location for India's plans to improve connectivity to southeast Asia. Until connectivity improves, Manipur will remain something of a dead end for trade and will likely be unable to overcome the bifurcation of its current politics, split between tribal groups inhabiting its hills and those in its central valley.
