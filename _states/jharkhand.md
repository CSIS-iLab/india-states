Long held up as an example of the poverty of India’s eastern regions, Jharkhand is seeking to capitalize on its mineral-rich terrain to boost development. The state presents an interesting dichotomy of development:  on one hand regions in the state are plagued by poverty, on the other, the state houses one of India’s largest commercial manufacturing units by Tata Motors along with the world’s 10th largest steel manufacturer located in the city of Jamshedpur.    While the government hopes to bolster its textile, food processing, automobile and auto components sectors and improve the state of its health and medical education, lingering left-wing violence and poor infrastructure still need to be addressed.
