One of the isolated states of India’s northeast, Tripura is located between Assam, Mizoram and shares an international border with Bangladesh. It is rich in natural resources such as natural gas and limestone and is also one of the largest producers of rubber in the country, but it has little industry. Tripura was governed by the Indian communist party for decades until the recent elections in 2018 during which the BJP swept into power. The new government could leverage the state’s high literacy rates and proximity to Bangladesh and Southeast Asia to turn it into a trade transit hub.
