One of the isolated states of India's northeast, Tripura is located between Assam, Mizoram and shares an international border with Bangladesh. It is rich in natural resources such as natural gas and limestone, and is also one of the largest producers of rubber in the country, but it has little industry. Tripura is one of the last strongholds of the Indian communist party, which has governed the state for decades.
