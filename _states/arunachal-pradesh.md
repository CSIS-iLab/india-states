Arunachal Pradesh is the largest by area of the so-called "Seven Sisters" of northeastern India. With a predominantly agrarian economy, Arunachal Pradesh has the lowest density of population compared to other states in India, and much of the state is uninhabitable due to its extreme terrain. While Arunachal Pradesh has some hydroelectric projects underway, its primary significant comes from the disputed border with China, which has been a source of friction for over 50 years.
