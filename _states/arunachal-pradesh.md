Arunachal Pradesh is the largest by area of the so-called “Seven Sisters” of northeastern India. With a predominantly agrarian economy, Arunachal Pradesh has the lowest population density of any Indian state. Its terrain of dense forests, mountains and unique Tibetan Buddhist culture makes it ideal for adventure and religious tourism.  The power sector plays a significant role in the state’s development with a potential of 50,000 megawatts (MW) of hydropower capacity.  The state has three international borders with the longest, an 1,080 kilometer stretch shared with China, being a source of conflict between the two countries.
