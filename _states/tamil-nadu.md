Tamil Nadu, which prizes its distinctiveness and independence from northern India, was one of India's first states to industrialize and has built an impressive industrial base. Its high-functioning bureaucracy is known for excellent administration of welfare schemes, giving the state some of the best social indicators in India. In recent years, however, Tamil Nadu's competitiveness has slipped as its government has been slow to adopt reforms or to appeal to foreign investors.
