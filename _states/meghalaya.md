Sandwiched between Bangladesh and the Indian state of Assam, Meghalaya is distinguished from the much larger Assam by its hilly terrain and largely Christian population. With little trade or industry, the state's population largely supports itself with subsistence farming, but the abundance of water makes Meghalaya an important location for hydroelectric power development.
