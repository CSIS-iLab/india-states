New Delhi is the capital of the Republic of India and the seat of the central government. One of the largest cities in India, its economy no longer depends wholly on government offices; Delhi nourishes a thriving IT sector and its neighboring suburbs of Noida and Gurugram are home to the offices of many of India's top corporations.
