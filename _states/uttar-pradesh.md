Uttar Pradesh is India's largest state in terms of population and often acts as the center of gravity of northern Indian politics. Underdeveloped and historically seen as ungovernable, Uttar Pradesh struggles with almost every challenge modern India faces: poverty, communal tension, poor infrastructure, etc. Yet the state has seen growth in recent years, and the scale of its problems offers an unbeatable opportunity to test innovative solutions.
