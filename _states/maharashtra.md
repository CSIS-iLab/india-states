Maharashtra is India's economic powerhouse, home to the economic capital of Mumbai and the source of 40% of the central government's tax revenues. But the massive state also embodies many of India's contradictions; its eastern reaches are remote, prone to drought, and deeply poor. The current government is seeking to bring development to those areas while not neglecting the needs of fractious and ungovernable Mumbai.
