Maharashtra is India’s economic powerhouse, home to the economic capital of Mumbai and the source of a significant source of the central government’s tax revenues. Thanks in large part to the many industries located in the state and progressive government policies, since the early 2000s, the state remains a top destination for investors in a range of sectors.  But the massive state also embodies many of India’s contradictions; its eastern reaches are remote, prone to drought, and deeply poor. The current government is seeking to bring development to those areas while not neglecting the needs of its urban centers including the megacity of Mumbai.
