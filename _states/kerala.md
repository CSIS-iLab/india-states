Kerala is proud of its reputation as one of India's most independent states, pursuing a course quite different from that laid out by the central government. It has nurtured a leftist economic model that has brought stellar human development indicators but has failed to provide enough jobs, leading millions of residents to seek work in the Gulf over the past generation. Kerala is now seeking to create jobs at home, with a strong emphasis on making itself an IT and start-up hub.
