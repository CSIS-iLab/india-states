The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill, 2019 converted the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into two separate union territories, namely the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Union Territory of Ladakh. Governments at the helm of affairs in the erstwhile state and present union territory have prioritized infrastructure development within the state to improve connectivity, and better integrate it with the rest of India. Jammu & Kashmir is largely dependent on agriculture, handicrafts and tourism, although the lowland Jammu region has had more success at building industry.
