Odisha struggles with significant challenges, including a difficult neighborhood, persistent left-wing violence, and interior districts that are some of the poorest and most isolated in India. The state government, led by the Biju Janata Dal, has largely responded with populist measures that have won it unusual stability in office. Increased pressure from the opposition, however, may prompt the government to rethink its approach.
