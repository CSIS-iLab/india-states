Once a conservative and sleepy agrarian state, Haryana has capitalized on its proximity to Delhi to transform itself into one of India's most developed states, with a large automobile industry and a major financial and industrial hub in the Delhi suburb of Gurugram. Haryana's diversified economy--it is also home to a major IT industry--and its willingness to experiment with reforms of have made it one of India's most dynamic states, although village life remains intensely conservative and women face many barriers to economic participation.
