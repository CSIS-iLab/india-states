The Andaman and Nicobar (A&N) Islands are a union territory comprising of 836 islands, 38 of which are inhabited. The two group of islands are in the Bay of Bengal, separated from Thailand and Myanmar by the Andaman Sea. The islands are also closely located to Indonesia.

The islandsâ€™ economy is largely agrarian producing coconut, areca nut, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. Fishing is also an important source of livelihood. The A&N Islands are popular with tourists due to their sparsely populated beaches, scenic forests, and lush greenery.

The A&N Islands play an important role strategically in the security and surveillance of the Indo-Pacific region. The islands have also been the sight of recent Japanese investments in infrastructure, including $36 million to install a battery energy storage system on the island of South Andaman to utilize renewable energy and stabilize the energy supply.
