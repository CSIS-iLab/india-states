Mountainous Himachal Pradesh, although a relatively well-off state, is also one of India's slowest growing economies. Almost 90 percent of the state's population lives in rural areas, and the economy is thus largely driven by agriculture and hydropower generation. Himachal Pradesh's difficult terrain, lack of infrastructure, and status as a backwater that shares a high-altitude border with China have made industries slow to enter the state.
