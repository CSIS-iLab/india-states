Mizoram is perhaps the most isolated of any of India’s states, surrounded as it is by Bangladesh in the west and Myanmar in the east. The cultural, religious, and linguistic distinctiveness of the native Mizo people have made the state slow to integrate with India as a whole. Suspicion of outsiders and special treatment from the central government has made the state reluctant to adopt market-based approaches to development.  Should non-agriculture related industries take root, they will be supported by a population that ranks 2nd highest on literacy in the country.
