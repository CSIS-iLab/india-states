The new state of Andhra Pradesh has charted an aggressive course for becoming the most business-friendly state in India since it was divided from the state of Telangana in 2014.  With nearly 50 million people and a long coastline, the state aims to become a logistics hub linking India to global markets.  The government is taking advantage of the opportunity to start greenfield developments to develop several ports, airports, and develop a well-designed state capital at Amaravati.  The state’s agriculture-based economy makes it the largest producer of fruits and oil palm and the second largest producer of silk in the country.
