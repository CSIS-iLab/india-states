The Union Territory of Ladakh was established on 31st October 2019, following the passage of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act. The region is known for its natural beauty and high-altitude terrain. The union territory is sparsely populated, and the economy is largely dependent on domestic and foreign tourism, and agriculture. In January 2021, the central government and the Central Water Commission sanctioned eight hydropower projects of 144-megawatt capacity on the Indus River and its tributaries in Ladakh. Since the state experiences approximately 320 days of clear sunlight, it has been identified as an ideal location for future solar power generation. Ladakh has also been the sight of a tense standoff between Indian and Chinese troops, especially in the disputed Aksai Chin region in the east and along the “line of actual control” between India and China.
