Bihar has a historical reputation of being India’s the poorest, densest, and most lawless state, rich only in emigrants who provide low-wage labor in every city in India. However, in recent years, Bihar has frequently achieved double-digit growth thanks to the state government’s relentless focus on public works and on ensuring that even the poorest inhabitants can access state hand-outs. While this has raised the standard of living somewhat, Bihar is yet to position itself as a competitor for private investment.  Being largely an agrarian economy, the state government hopes to add value to its food processing and dairy industries and strengthening its textile and leather industries.
