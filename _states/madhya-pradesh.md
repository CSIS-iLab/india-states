Madhya Pradesh, India's second largest state by area, is seeking to build a reputation as one of the country's most dynamic states despite the steep challenges presented by a poor, largely agrarian and rural population. Led by a stable and vigorous government closely aligned with Prime Minister Modi, the state is seeking to attract foreign investment in agribusiness and manufacturing.
