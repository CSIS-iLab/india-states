Rajasthan is the largest state in India by area, much of which is composed of the nearly uninhabitable Thar desert. Rajasthan's lack of water long kept it a deeply poor state of nomadic herdsmen, but the present government is working hard to diversify the economy, using bold reforms in an attempt to attract investment and industry.
