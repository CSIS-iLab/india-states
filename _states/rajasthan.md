Rajasthan is the largest state in India by area, much of which is composed of the vast Thar desert. Historically, Rajasthan has lagged on several human development indicators.  Successive governments have focused on improving inter-state and intra-state connectivity while unleashing policies to attract manufacturing service industries.  Rajasthan is the top tourist destination in the country thanks to its rich history of princely states.  Aside from the tourism industry, the state is leveraging its geostrategic location to help develop manufacturing clusters along India’s dedicated western freight corridor that will link Delhi to Mumbai.
