Sikkim sticks out sharply from India's northern border, sharing frontiers with more countries (Nepal, China, and Bhutan) than it does with fellow states (West Bengal). Its mountainous terrain has kept it culturally and economically isolated from the rest of India, with agriculture and tourism major industries, but in recent years Sikkim has harnessed the power of central government investment to become one of India's fastest growing states.
