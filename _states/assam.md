Assam is most populous and economically active of the northeastern states and thus acts as the nexus between the mainland and the northeast. Assam has historically failed to attract major industries, however, and its primary economic drivers are tea plantations and minor oil resources. Illegal immigration from Bangladesh is perceived as a major problem and has driven increased religious conflict in the state over the past 10 years. The BJP recently took control of the state legislature for the first time ever; increased alignment with the central government may improve the state's prospects.
