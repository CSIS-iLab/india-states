The tiny coastal state of Goa has a reputation as one of India's most relaxed states, thanks to its beaches and to the lifestyle that comes with the highest per capita GDP of any state in India. Wealth from tourism, mining, and the pharmaceutical industry, together with good governance, have brought high levels of development: almost every home in Goa is electrified. Perhaps resting on its laurels, the state has not fully entered the competition for foreign investment and ranked a surprisingly low 21 on the center's ease of doing business index.
