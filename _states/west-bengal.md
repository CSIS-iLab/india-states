With the Himalayas to the north, and the Bay of Bengal to the south, West Bengal is the largest and most economically important state in eastern India. Although it was once one of the richest and most industrialized states in India, decades of left-wing government largely succeeded in driving out international investors. Under the stable government of Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal is seeking to attract investment once again while hanging on to its leftist bona fides.
