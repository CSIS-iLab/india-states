The so-called "Gujarat model" of development--attracting foreign investment through high-quality infrastructure and an intense attention to the needs of investors--has made Gujarat one of India's richest and most industrialized states and catapulted long-time Chief Minister Narendra Modi to national power in 2014. Gujarat remains on of India's most attractive investment destinations, but the Gujarat model has been criticized for failing to improve the lives of the states poor, and Gujarat has not had equal success in developing 21st century industries such as the IT sector.
