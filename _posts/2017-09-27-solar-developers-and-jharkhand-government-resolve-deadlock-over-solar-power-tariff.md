Solar developers and the Jharkhand government have resolved an 18-month long deadlock over the price of solar power, with the developers agreeing to a reduced tariff of 7.6 cents per kwH. The Jharkhand Renewable Energy Development Agency had auctioned 1,200 MW of solar capacity in March 2016, with winning bids ranging from 7.8 cents to 8.4 cents per kwH for large-scale projects. When later auctions in other states resulted in far lower bids, the Jharkhand government refused to sign contracts with the auction winners.
