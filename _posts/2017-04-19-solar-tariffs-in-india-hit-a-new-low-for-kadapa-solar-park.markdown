Solar tariffs in India hit another new low at the auction of 250 megawatts (MW) of capacity at the Kadapa Solar Park. Solairedirect Energy India, a subsidiary of the French power giant Engie, won the auction with a bid of 4.89 cents per kilowatt hour. Previous auctions have resulted in slightly lower initial tariffs that gradually increased over the contract period, resulting in a higher overall tariff.
