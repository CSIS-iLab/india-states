The state government signed an MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) to improve the energy efficiency of the stateâ€™s public works and sewage systems. EESL will audit approximately water and sewage 300 pumps in municipal areas across Goa to determine their efficiency and will then recommend either replacing or retrofitting them.
