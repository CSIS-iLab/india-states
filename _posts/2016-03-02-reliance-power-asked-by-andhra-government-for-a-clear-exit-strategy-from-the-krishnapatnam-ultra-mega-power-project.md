Andhra Pradesh has asked Reliance Power to submit a “clear exit proposal” regarding its decision not to go forward with the 4,000 MW Krishnapatnam Ultra Mega Power Project. It is seeking to formally exit the project due to rising costs, more than 8 years after Reliance committed to building the plant.
