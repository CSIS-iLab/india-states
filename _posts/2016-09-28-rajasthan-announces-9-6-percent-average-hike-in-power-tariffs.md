The Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission announced a revised power tariff, with an average hike of 9.6 percent in various consumer categories — the full increase sought by state discoms. Most consumer categories saw an 11 to 12 percent increase, while tariffs for use in agriculture were raised 5.5 percent. This is Rajasthan’s fifth revision since 2006.
