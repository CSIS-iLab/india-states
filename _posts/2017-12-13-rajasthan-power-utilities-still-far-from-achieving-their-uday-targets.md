Close to the two-year anniversary of signing the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) agreement with the central government, Rajasthanâ€™s three state-owned electricity distribution companies (discoms) are still far from achieving their targets. The discoms reduced aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses from 27.5 percent to 26.2 percent, still well above the Fiscal Year 2018 target of 18.78 percent.
