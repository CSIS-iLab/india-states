Jharkhand’s state-owned power distribution company, Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Ltd (JBVNL) is once again in debt despite Jharkhand’s early entry into the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana, the center’s debt relief scheme for state electricity distribution bodies. Jharkhand signed on in September 2015, making it the first state to join the scheme, and received debt relief totaling $814 million. One year later, JBVNL now owes $230 million to power producers.
