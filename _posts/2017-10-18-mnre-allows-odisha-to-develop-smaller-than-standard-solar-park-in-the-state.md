The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy will allow Odisha to develop a smaller than standard solar park with 400 MW capacity under the Scheme for Development of Solar Parks and Ultra Mega Solar Power Projects. The state government failed to identify a contiguous patch of 5,000 acres of land for developing a 1,000 MW park.
