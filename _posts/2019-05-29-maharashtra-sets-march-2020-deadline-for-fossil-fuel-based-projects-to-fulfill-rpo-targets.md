The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) has given fossil fuel-based co-generation projects in Maharashtra until March 2020 to fulfill their renewable purchase obligation (RPO) targets. The order effectively rolls over the projectsâ€™ RPO obligations from between 2016 and 2019 until the fiscal year 2019-20.
