State-run Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL) was the lowest bidder in the tender to build a 2,400-MW coal-fired power plant, a joint venture by the National Thermal Power Corporation and the government of Jharkhand. BHELâ€™s bid of $1.8 billion ($750,000 per MW) beat out other contenders such as Larsen & Toubro and Korea's Doosan.
