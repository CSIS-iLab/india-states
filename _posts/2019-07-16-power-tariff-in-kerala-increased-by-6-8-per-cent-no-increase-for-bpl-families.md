The Kerala State Electricity Board announced that it has increased the power tariff by 6.8 percent. However, the revised rates will not be applicable to families that fall below the poverty line, cancer patients, and polio patients. Additionally, people who are permanently disabled due to an accident will be given a reduction in tariff.
