The Bihar Renewable Energy Development Agency (BREDA) has issued two requests for proposal inviting bidders to develop grid-connected floating solar power projects. While one project of up to 2 megawatts (MW) will be developed on private water bodies, another 2 MW is slated to be developed on a government-owned body of water.
