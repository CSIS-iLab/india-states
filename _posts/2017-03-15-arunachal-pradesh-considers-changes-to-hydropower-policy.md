Arunachal Pradesh is planning to rethink its hydropower policy in light of the long delays facing hydropower in the state. Nearly 140 hydropower projects have been stuck in development, some for a decade, due to delays getting clearances. The state has more than a third of Indiaâ€™s hydropower potential.
