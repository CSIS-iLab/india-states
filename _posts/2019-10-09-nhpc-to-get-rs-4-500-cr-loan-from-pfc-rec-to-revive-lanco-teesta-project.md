NHPC is taking a loan of $635.8 million from state-owned lenders, Power Finance Corporation and Rural Electricity Corporation, to revive the Lanco Teesta project in Sikkim. The Union government-owned hydropower major has become the first public sector unit to take over a stressed asset through a resolution process in the National Company Law Tribunal.
