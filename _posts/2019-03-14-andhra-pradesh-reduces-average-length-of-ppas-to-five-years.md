The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission has proposed reducing the average length of the power purchase agreement from 25 years to five years. The proposed decision has alarmed industry, who has argued that such a short contract length will lower tariffs, while state distribution companies support the move, allowing them to take advantage of lower tariffs offered by newer plants.
