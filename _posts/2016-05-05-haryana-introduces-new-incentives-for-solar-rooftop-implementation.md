The Haryana government will allow all property owners to install grid-connected rooftop solar power plants with capacity from 1 kilowatt peak (KWp) to 1 megawatt peak (MWp) under net-metering regulations in the state. Haryana will also allow property-owners to sell power from such plants either to the government or a third party. The government is also providing a 30 percent subsidy, up to a maximum of $300 per KWp, for installation of solar power plants on three categories of buildings—residential, institutional, and non-profit organizations.
