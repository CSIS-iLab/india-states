Karnataka and Goa have joined the center’s Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), a bailout scheme for the power sector that allows state governments to take on the debt held by state-owned power distribution companies. Although 12 states have now joined the program, so far only Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh are planning to adjust tariffs to reduce their debt load.
