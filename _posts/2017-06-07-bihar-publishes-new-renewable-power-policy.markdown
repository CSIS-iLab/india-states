Bihar announced a new renewable power policy that aims to develop over 3,400 megawatts (MW) of non-fossil fuel-based capacity by 2022, making Bihar self-sufficient in power generation. Nearly 3,000 MW capacity would be in solar (one-third of it rooftop solar), with the rest coming from biogas and small hydropower plants.
