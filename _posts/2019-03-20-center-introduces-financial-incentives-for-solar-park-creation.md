The center introduced new financial incentives for states and tweaked its policy to address two major issues plaguing solar park developers â€” shortage of land and lack of transmission facility. The center will offer states $0.0002 for every kilowatt-hour, or unit, of power produced at the solar parks, and will change its policy regarding the development of solar parks and ultra-mega solar parks in a bid to ease constraints related to availability of land and transmission infrastructure irrespective.
