The Madhya Pradesh Paschim Kshetra Vidyut Vitaran Company Ltd. will make it compulsory for both commercial and residential consumers to submit a photograph while applying for a new power connection. Contractors installing supply lines will have to submit a report on how much supply is needed for each connection. The moves are meant to control power loss and avoid cases of overloading.
