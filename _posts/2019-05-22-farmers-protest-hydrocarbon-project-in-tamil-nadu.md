Farmers in Tamil Nadu have begun protesting a planned hydrocarbon project in the Thiruvarur, Nagappatinam, Pudukottai, and Thanjavore districts of Tamil Nadu. The central government had earlier given in-principle approval to Oil and Natural Gas Corporation and the Vedanta group for hydrocarbon extraction in the region.
