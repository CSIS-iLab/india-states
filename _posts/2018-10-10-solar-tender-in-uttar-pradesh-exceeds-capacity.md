The latest solar tender of Indiaâ€™s Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Development Agency has exceeded the targeted capacity of 500MW by attracting 750 MW of proposals. The tender, which was capped at $0.04/kWh, was launched in July following the cancellation of an earlier 1-GW auction due to the high level of quoted tariffs.
