The AP Electricity Regulatory Commission approved increases of 3 to 6 percent in power tariffs for the new fiscal year. Agricultural consumers and those who use small amounts of power per month will not see any change in their bills, but heavy electricity users will pay more per unit. The increase will bring in an additional $123 million per year; the stateâ€™s distribution companies owe $1.24 billion.
