State-owned power producer National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) Ltd said its board has approved its first wind energy project, a 50 megawatt (MW) project to be built in Gujarat at a cost of $48 million. The move will help NTPC reach its target of sourcing about 11 percent of its planned capacity from renewable energy by 2032.
