Criticizing the Jammu and Kashmir government for lack of effort in recovering power tariff arrears, the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India said the state has "poorly" realized electricity dues for the past five years, resulting in arrears of over $311 million. Dues recovered ranged between 40 and 60 percent of the total due.
