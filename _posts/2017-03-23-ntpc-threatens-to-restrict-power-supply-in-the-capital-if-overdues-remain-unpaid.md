The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has once again threatened to restrict power supply to Delhi if two of the cityâ€™s distribution companies (discoms) fail to pay their overdue bills soon. Ten months, after NTPC first formally notified the discoms that it would cut back power to the city, they still owe $36.5 million. The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) will conduct an audit of the assets of all three discoms.
