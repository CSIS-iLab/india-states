The Jammu and Kashmir State Power Development Corporation (JKSPDC) has terminated 30 planned hydropower projects totalling over 400 MW of capacity despite previous claims that work on the projects had started years ago. A government evaluation in late 2014 had stated that tenders had been issued for 28 of the projects.
