The Tamil Nadu Generation & Distribution Co (TANGEDCO) has asked the winners of a solar power capacity auction held in January-February 2017 to reduce tariffs to 5.4 cents per unit, down from the 6.9 cents per unit originally bid, to match the winning bid in a subsequent auction. TANGEDCO has refused to sign power purchase agreements at the higher tariff.
