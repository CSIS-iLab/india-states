The Himachal Pradesh agency for renewable energy, Himurja, has announced its new program that seeks to deploy 28 MW solar energy projects in the state. The state has invited proposals from local entrepreneurs for setting up ground-mounted solar power projects with capacities ranging from 250 kilowatts (kW) to 500 kW. The projects can be set up on private land owned by the applicant or on leased land.
