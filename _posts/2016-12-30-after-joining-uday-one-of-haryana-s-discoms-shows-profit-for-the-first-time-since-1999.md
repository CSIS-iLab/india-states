Haryana’s Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN) — one of the state’s two power distribution companies (discoms) — became the first discom to eliminate its operating losses after joining a central government debt relief initiative. DHBVN, which joined the scheme, known as UDAY, on March 11, posted a profit of $30 million in the first half of the current financial year compared to a loss of $70.5 million last financial year. This represents DHBVN’s first operating profit since its founding in 1999. Haryana’s other discom posted a loss of $182 million in the first six months of the fiscal year.
