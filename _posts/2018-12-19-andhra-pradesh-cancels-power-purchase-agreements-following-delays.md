The Andhra Pradesh government granted permission to the Andhra Pradesh Power Coordination Committee and state power distribution companies to cancel a 2016 continuation agreement and a 1998 power purchase agreement with Hinduja National Power Corporation Limited, Visakhapatnam, following several delays in the project completion schedule that led to rising capital costs.
