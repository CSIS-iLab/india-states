Himachal Pradesh is preparing to introduce a state-wide Energy Conservation Building Code (ECBC) following the model created by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency. The Code will apply to new and existing commercial buildings with a connected load of 50kW or more. The ECBC sets minimum energy performance standard for design of building envelopes, HVAC systems, lighting, electrical systems, and hot water systems.
