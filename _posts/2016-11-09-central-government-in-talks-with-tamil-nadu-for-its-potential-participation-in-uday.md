The center and the Tamil Nadu government are searching for a compromise that will allow the state to join the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme for restructuring state discom debt. The Tamil Nadu government has stated that it will join the scheme only if it is allowed to exceed the cap on state debt for 15 years, rather than the two years other states are being allowed, and that it will take over only 22 percent of its discomsâ€™ debt, rather than 75 percent.
