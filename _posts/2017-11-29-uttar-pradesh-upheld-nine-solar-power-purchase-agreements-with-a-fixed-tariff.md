The Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission upheld Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) signed by the Uttar Pradesh Power Corp with nine independent solar power producers but set the tariff for all nine PPAs at the lowest bid, 10.9 cents per unit. The PPAs were the result of a 2015 auction which resulted in discovered tariffs ranging from 10.9 to 13.3 cents per unit.
