Maharashtra unveiled its new energy conservation policy, which promises to save $932 million and 1,000 MW of electricity over five years. The state will spend $1.25 million to switch to energy-efficient light bulbs and appliances. The state also mandated that all new buildings in the state be designed for only LED bulbs. Maharashtra will amend the Development Control Rules of municipal corporations and other civic bodies to ensure compliance.
