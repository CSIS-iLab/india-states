Kakmayai village in Manipur's Thoubal district became the first village in the state to make the switch to LED lamps. A local NGO provided residents with LED bulbs to replace conventional lights in the village. Each household will receive two LED bulbs free and will be able to purchase additional ones at a nominal fee.
