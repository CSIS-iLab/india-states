The Supreme Court asked the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) to amend the power purchase agreements (PPAs) signed with Tata Power, Adani Power, and Essar Power for their imported coal-based thermal plants in Gujarat. It gave the CERC eight weeks to consider and approve the tariff hike for the three plants proposed by the High Power Committee appointed by the Gujarat government.
