The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (Mahadiscom), the Maharashtra electricity distribution company, is planning to invite international bids to implement the distribution franchisee model in six more locations. Currently, the model, in which a private company provides electricity at a set rate and collects dues, is used in parts of the Bhiwandi, Nagpur, Aurangabad, and Jalgaon distribution circles.
