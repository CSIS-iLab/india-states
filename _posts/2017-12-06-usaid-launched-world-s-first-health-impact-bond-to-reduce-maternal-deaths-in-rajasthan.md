The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the world's first health-impact bond, the Utkrisht Impact Bond, to reduce maternal and neo-natal deaths in Rajasthan. The $2.25 million bond is a public-private partnership, with private funders paying to improve private health facilities. USAID will pay out on the bonds only if the providers achieve certain targets.
