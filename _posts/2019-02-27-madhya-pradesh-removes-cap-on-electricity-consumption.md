The Madhya Pradesh government removed a 100-unit cap on electricity consumption for which poor consumers can claim subsidies. The cap was installed after it was found that only 146,000 consumers, or 2.3 percent of the 6.2 million poor power consumers in the state, were claiming 30 percent of the $21.1 million in subsidies offered by government.
