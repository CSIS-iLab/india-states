The Odisha government’s Housing and Urban Development department signed an MoU with Energy Efficiency Service Limited (EESL) for implementation of the national LED streetlight program in all the state’s 107 towns. EESL will replace all conventional streetlights with LED lights within a year. The change could help the state save 36 million units of electricity and $4.2 million annually.
