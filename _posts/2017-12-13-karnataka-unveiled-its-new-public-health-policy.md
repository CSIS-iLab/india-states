The Karnataka government unveiled its new public health policy. The policy recognizes that Karnataka's health outcomes lag those of its neighbors and that is suffers from regional disparities and gaps in secondary and tertiary coverage. It commits the state to, among other actions, increasing access to care, particularly primary health care; implementing electronic medical records; and establishing 24x7 generic drug dispensaries on site at second- and third-tier healthcare facilities.
