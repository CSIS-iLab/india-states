The Gujarat governmentâ€™s auction of 700 megawatts (MW) of solar projects at Raghanesda Solar Park attracted bids for 600 MW of the total project allocation despite having a ceiling price of $0.0039 (Rs 2.70) per kilowatt-hour (kWh), or unit. The auction was previously cancelled in January after the government stated that the quoted tariff of $0.0041 (Rs. 2.84) was too high.
