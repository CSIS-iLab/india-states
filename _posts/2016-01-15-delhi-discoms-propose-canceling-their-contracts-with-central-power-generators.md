Delhi’s power distribution companies (discoms) have asked the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission to allow them to terminate their power procurement contracts with state-run companies NTPC Ltd., NHPC Ltd., and THDC India Ltd. The two discoms are looking at cheaper power sources, including power banking arrangements under which they would supply surplus electricity to other states and be allowed to draw on those states’ power supply when in need.
