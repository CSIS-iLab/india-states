The Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission has kept solar procurement rates unchanged from last year, keeping generic levelized tariff for power generated from solar photovoltaic (PV) for FY 2019-20 at $0.06 (Rs. 4.17) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) without accelerated depreciation. The tariff rate for solar PV with accelerated depreciation was fixed at $0.057 (Rs. 3.92) per kWh.
