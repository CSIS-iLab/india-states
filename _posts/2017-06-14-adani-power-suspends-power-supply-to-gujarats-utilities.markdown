Adani Power Ltd has suspended supplying power to Gujaratâ€™s utilities despite a 25-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) which guarantees 1,800 MW of supply per year. Adani has stated that higher fuel costs at its Mundra Power Plant have made it impossible to provide power at the PPA cost of 3.6 cents per unit.
