The Solar Energy Corporation of India scrapped a requirement that 150 MW of a planned 750 MW capacity to be built at the Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan follow local content requirements. The entire 750 MW will now be tendered without local content requirements. The decision may have been linked to a recent WTO ruling that India’s local content requirements for solar plants violated the organization’s rules.
