The West Bengal government is finalizing a new solar policy to help it meet the target of generating 4,500 MW of solar power by 2022. The draft policy allows the state’s electricity regular to reduce or abolish open access charges — fees levied when an industrial consumer purchases power from a source other than the state-owned distribution companies. Current open access charges are so high as to make open access cost-prohibitive.
