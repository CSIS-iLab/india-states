The Uttar Pradesh State Electricity Regulatory Commission held a hearing to question the UP Power Corporation Limited (UPPCL) over its purchase of power at higher than market rates. The Commission questioned UPPCL on its reluctance to source power from the exchanges where the cost has come down substantially, often to below $0.03 a unit.
