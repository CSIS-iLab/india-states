Uttarakhand is set to become the first state in the country to provide air ambulance for people living in hills and far-flung areas, who face difficulties in accessing health services due to bad roads. The proposal, drafted under the aegis of National Health Mission, has received an ‘in-principle’ approval and will be fully funded by the center.
