Maharashtra will expand its injectable contraceptives program by extending the availability of intramuscular contraceptive injections, a reversible method of contraception, to sub-district and rural hospitals, and will work with the United Nations Population Fund. According to state data, since last year, approximately 7,500 women have used the contraceptive programs.
