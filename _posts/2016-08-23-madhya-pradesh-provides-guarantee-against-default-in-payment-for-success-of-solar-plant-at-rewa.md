The Madhya Pradesh government will extend a state guarantee to the contractor of its flagship solar plant at Rewa. The guarantee would insure Rewa Ultra Mega Solar, a joint venture of state and central government entities, against any default in payment. Described as the worldâ€™s largest contiguous solar park, the project entails an investment of $1.12 billion.
