The National Green Tribunal declined to lift the current ban on operation of diesel vehicles more than a decade old in the Delhi area. The panel said the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public Enterprises has failed to prove that the use of 10-year-old diesel vehicles will not be harmful to the health of people.
