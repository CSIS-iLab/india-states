The Tamil Nadu government has signed an MOU to merge the existing Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme of the state, introduced in 2009, with the prime minister’s Jan Arogya Yojana or Ayushman Bharat program. Tamil Nadu’s health insurance scheme covers 15.7 million families and gives up to $6,800 every year, per family, on par with the prime minister’s scheme.
