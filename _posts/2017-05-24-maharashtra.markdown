Maharashtra signed an MoU with Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) to increase the energy efficiency of nearly 1,500 buildings owned by the state Public Works Department. EESL will invest nearly $50.2 million to upgrade lighting systems and replace existing air-conditioners and fans with more efficient models.
