Adani Transmission said it has acquired two transmission utilities from Rajasthan’s state transmission corporation through competitive bidding. Rajasthan formed the two special purpose vehicles (SPVs) — Barmer Power Transmission Service Ltd (BPTSL) and Thar Power Transmission Service Ltd — in 2016 to set up 132 kilovolt substations and associated transmission lines. The two utilities have now become wholly-owned subsidiaries of Adani Transmission.
