The National Hydropower Corporation (NHPC) is experimenting with a new revenue-sharing model for wind power. Tribal communities in Palakkad district will receive 5 percent of revenue from an 8 MW wind farm built on their land. In 2014 the previous state government tried to build 82 MW of wind capacity in the area but abandoned the project due to difficulties acquiring land.
