The stateâ€™s electricity regulator and its main generation utility are at loggerheads over the cost of wind power. The Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (APERC) set tariffs between 6.8 and 7.4 cents per kwH for wind power in the current financial year, but the Andhra Pradesh Power Generation Corporation (APGENCO) believes it can use auctions to purchase wind power at closer to 5.4 cents.
