Power sector workers across the state are planning to go on strike on June 29 and 30 in order to protest outsourcing of jobs in the power utilities. The government has invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) for the next six months, directing all deputy commissioners and the director general of police to make necessary arrangements to ensure continuous supply of power for the state.
