The Madhya Pradesh government decided to provide electricity at $0.013 per unit, or kilowatt-hour, to all domestic consumers using up to 100 units every month, with an upper cap of 150 units. The proposal was cleared at a cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Kamal Nath. “Till now, this subsidized scheme of providing 100 units per month at a rate of $0.013 per unit was meant for poor laborers registered under Indira Griha Jyoti Yojana.”
