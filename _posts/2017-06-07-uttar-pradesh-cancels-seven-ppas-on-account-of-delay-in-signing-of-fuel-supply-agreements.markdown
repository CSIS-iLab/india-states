Uttar Pradesh has cancelled power purchase agreements (PPAs) with seven power projects, only one of which had started operation, with a cumulative capacity of 7,040 MW. The PPAs, signed in 2010, were cancelled because the plants were not able to sign fuel supply agreements within a reasonable time.
