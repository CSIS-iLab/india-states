The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd has launched a drive to hundreds of thousands of dollars in dues from over 60,000 consumers in the Aurangabad area who have not made payments for the past three months. The company has disconnected over 600 connections since February 1, when the drive was launched.
