The Global Wind Energy Council's (GWEC's) Fowind consortium has commissioned India’s first offshore Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system in the Gulf of Khambhat, off the coast of Gujarat. The data from the LIDAR will be used by the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy to explore the potential for offshore wind off India’s coast.
