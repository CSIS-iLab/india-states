Minister of State for Power R K Singh presided over a conference of state power ministers in Delhi. The group discussed universal metering, 100 percent electrification, and reducing cross-subsidization (the practice of charging some consumers high rates in order to pay for subsidized power for other users). Minister Singh said the central government intends to amend the Electricity Act to prohibit state distribution utilities from factoring in transmission losses of more than 15 percent when calculating new tariffs.
