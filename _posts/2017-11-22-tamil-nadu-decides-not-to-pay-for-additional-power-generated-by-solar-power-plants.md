Solar developers are protesting the Tamil Nadu government’s decision not to pay for additional power they produce by achieving higher efficiencies. The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Co. has decided not to pay for the excess power generated by any solar plant which exceeds a capacity utilisation factor of 19 percent. Producers claim the decision has already cost them over $15 million.
