The Andhra Pradesh Transmission Company (APTransco) hosted a workshop on the development of a state-level energy scenario generator, the first ever such modeling tool for a sub-national entity. Funded by the British High Commission and led by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and NITI Aayog, the scenario generator allows the user to model the stateâ€™s energy future according to different inputs. Scenario generators for Assam and Gujarat are also in the works.
