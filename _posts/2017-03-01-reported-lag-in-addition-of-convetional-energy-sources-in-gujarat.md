Subdued electricity demand coupled with surplus availability has led to a marked slowdown in the addition of new capacity from conventional energy sources in Gujarat. Installed electricity generation capacity of non-renewable sources grew by just 0.7 percent in 2015-16, compared to 6.2 percent in 2013-14.
