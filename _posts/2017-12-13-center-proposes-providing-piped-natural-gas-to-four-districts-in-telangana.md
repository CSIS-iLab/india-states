The center has proposed supplying four districts of Telangana — Khammam, Medak, Ranga Reddy, and Nalgonda — with piped natural gas (PNG) at an estimated cost of $93 million over five years. The offer is dependent on the state government providing land at concessional rates for creating gas distribution infrastructure, such as compressed natural gas stations. Creation of a PNG infrastructure in urban areas will allow 175,000 gas cylinders to be diverted to rural areas every year.
