As of April 1, Haryana no longer distributes kerosene through the Public Distribution System, instead encouraging households to switch to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The state had connected 273,000 households to the LPG grid free of charge by the end of March 2017 and has budgeted $3 million to connect the remaining households.
