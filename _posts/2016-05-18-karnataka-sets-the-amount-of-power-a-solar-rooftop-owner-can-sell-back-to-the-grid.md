Karnataka became the first state to allow owners of rooftop solar power plants (domestic, hospitals and educational institutions) to increase the amount of solar power they sell back to the grid by up to 150 percent of the sanctioned amount. The state will buy the power at the rate of 10 cents per unit. In comparison, Gujarat only allows consumers to sell half of their sanctioned load.
