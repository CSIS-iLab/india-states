Adani Green Energy (Uttar Pradesh), a wholly owned subsidiary of Adani Green Energy, announced it commissioned a 50 MW alternating current (AC) solar power project. Under a 25-year power purchase agreement, the tariff agreed to is $0.072 per kWh. However, Adani has filed an appeal before Appellate Tribunal for Electricity challenging the reduction in the tariff from an earlier $0.12 per kWh to the current $0.072 per kWh.
