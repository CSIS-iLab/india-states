The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission notified new Supply Code and Performance Standards under which consumers will get a compensation of $0.15 per kilowatt (kW) per hour if a power outage persists for more than two or three hours. Households with sanctioned loads of up to 20 kW are eligible for the program.
