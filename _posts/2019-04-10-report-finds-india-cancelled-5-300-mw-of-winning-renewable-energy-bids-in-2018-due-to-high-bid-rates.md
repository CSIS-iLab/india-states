According to a report by a consulting group Bridge to India, Indiaâ€™s central and state government canceled 5,300 megawatts (MW) of valid winning bids in 2018 due to high bid rates. The cancelation of such auctions for renewable energy projects has saved central and state governments $490 billion, although companies have sharply criticized the practice as anti-investor.
