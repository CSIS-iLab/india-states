Haryana Power Generation Corporation Limited has bought 1 million networked power meters and plans to install them across the state in coming months to facilitate the switch to pre-paid power access. Consumers will pay in advance for electricity and can refill their balance just as they recharge cell phone minutes. The state will also eliminate the charge for paying electricity. Pre-paid consumers will also be exempt from fees for paying electricity bills online.
