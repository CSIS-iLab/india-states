Delhi announced that its new solar power policy will come into effect in April. The policy will include a list of vendors of solar panels who are eligible for the center’s 30 percent subsidy on rooftop solar system. Consumers will receive an incentive of 3 cents (INR 2) for every kilowatt of energy they generate from the systems.
