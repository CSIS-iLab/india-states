Struggling to find buyers outside of Odisha, the Odisha Power Generation Corporation (OPGC) has offered to sell power to the state grid from the planned second unit of its 1740 MW super critical power plant at Jharsuguda. OPGC is adding two 660 MW units to the existing 420 MW capacity. The first new unit is already dedicated to the state grid.
