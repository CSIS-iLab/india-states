Uttar Pradesh government has cancelled the long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) for 3,800 MW due to the cost of power under these pacts being higher than the spot market prices. The previous Samajwadi Party government signed the 15-year contracts with Jindal Power, JP-Nigeri, Lanco, Adani Power, GMR, and JSW.
