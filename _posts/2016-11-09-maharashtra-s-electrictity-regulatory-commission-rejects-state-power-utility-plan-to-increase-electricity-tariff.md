The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission has rejected the Maharashtra Electricity Distribution Company’s proposal for an average 5.5 percent increase in the electricity tariff for 2016-17 but has allowed a moderate hike of 1 to 1.3 percent for residential consumers for the current year and also for every fiscal year up to 2020. The residential tariff for Below Poverty Line consumers has also been extended to consumers with a sanctioned load up to 0.25 kilowatt (KW), as opposed to the earlier limit of 0.1 (KW).
