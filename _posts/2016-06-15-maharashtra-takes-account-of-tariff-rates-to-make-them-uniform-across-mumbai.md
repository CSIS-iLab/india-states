The Maharashtra government has asked power firms and distribution utilities to provide reports on tariff rates in order to implement a uniform power tariff in Mumbai. Currently, the multiple private and state-run electricity distribution companies (discoms), all charge different rates in different parts of Mumbai. The new uniform tariff could apply to over 40 percent of Mumbai’s residential population.
