Andhra Pradesh government has softened its stand on the controversial plan to reopen the power purchase agreements (PPAs) inked under the previous Telugu Desam Party government. Union Power and New and Renewable Energy minister Raj Kumar Singh said that he has seen a communication wherein the Andhra Pradesh state government has clarified that they will not open all PPAs, but only in those cases where malfeasance is established.
