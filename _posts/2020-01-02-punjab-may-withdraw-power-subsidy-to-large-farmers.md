A proposal to withdraw power subsides to “rich” farmers in Punjab was introduced during a special meeting convened by Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh. The final decision on the move, which could trigger a massive reaction from the state’s farming community, has not yet been taken. The subsidy for small and marginal farmers would continue.
