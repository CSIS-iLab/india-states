The Maharashtra government has decided to switch from individual solar-powered irrigation pumps to a feeder-based system in which multiple pumps are driven by a single power source. Despite government efforts, so far only 10,000 solar-powered irrigation pumps have been installed in the state, with farmers objecting to the high cost of the equipment. The feeder system, which requires farmers to pool resources to buy a single power source, offers lower up-front costs.
