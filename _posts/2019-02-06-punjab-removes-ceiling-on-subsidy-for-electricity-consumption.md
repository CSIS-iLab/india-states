The Punjab government announced it is removing a ceiling of 3,000 kilo-watt hours, or units, on electricity consumption for consumers from scheduled castes, backward classes, and from families below the poverty line. The decision would allow them to consume 200 units of power per month free of cost at a cost of $22.7 million to the state.
