The Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) has once again rejected Lanco Infratech’s request for a tariff revision for power generated at the 1,920 MW thermal power plant at Amarkantak. The company has asked the regulator three times to allow for increase in power tariff  to compensate for expenses incurred due to shifting of a metering point.
