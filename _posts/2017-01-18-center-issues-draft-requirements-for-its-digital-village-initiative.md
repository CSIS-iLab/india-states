The central government has issued draft requirements for its Digital Village initiative, which is meant to provide services such as tele-medicine, tele-education, WiFi hotspots, and LED street lighting in 100 villages across India. The requirements include setting up smart schools and three primary healthcare centers. Participating states and union territories will choose the implementing organizations.
