The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) settled a dispute regarding the determination of tariff rates for a hydroelectric project in Himachal Pradesh. Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited had filed a petition seeking to revise the tariff rates between 2009 and 2014 for a 1,500 MW hydroelectric project at the Nathpa Jhakri project.
