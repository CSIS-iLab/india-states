Andhra Pradesh has agreed to buy electricity from Kadapa Solar Park, where France's Engie had won a 250 megawatt (MW) solar auction held by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) without any buyer for the output.  NTPC agreed to bundle Kadapaâ€™s output with 125 MW capacity of thermal power, resulting in a lower overall tariff.
