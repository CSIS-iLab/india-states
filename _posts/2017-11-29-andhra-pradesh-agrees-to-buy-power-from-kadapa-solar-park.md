Andhra Pradesh has agreed to buy electricity from Kadapa Solar Park, where France's Engie had won a 250 megawatt (MW) solar auction held by the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) without any buyer for the output.  NTPC agreed to bundle Kadapa’s output with 125 MW capacity of thermal power, resulting in a lower overall tariff.
