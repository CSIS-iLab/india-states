Coal-based power projects are gradually losing traction in Odisha, with multiple developers deciding to shelve planned projects due to difficulty obtaining coal blocks. Tata Power, BGR Energy Systems Ltd, and Kalinga Energy and Power have communicated their intent to scrap their proposed coal-fired projects in the state. The three companies had planned coal-fired plants with a total capacity of more than 2 GW.
