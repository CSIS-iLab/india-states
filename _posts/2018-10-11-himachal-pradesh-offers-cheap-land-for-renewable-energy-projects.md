Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur announced that Himachal Pradesh is offering land at a rate of 1 cent per square meter to woo investors to set up renewable energy projects in the state. He went on to say that the state will allow deferred royalty payments, and that the state electricity board would buy power directly from renewable projects.
