Initiatives to improve the performance of Telanganaâ€™s two power distribution companies under the Ujjwal Discom Assurance Yojana have helped them reduce technical and commercial losses by 10 percent during the July-September quarter. Aggregate technical and commercial losses stood at 14.2 percent at the end of the first quarter but fell to 12.8 percent by the end of the second quarter. Progress still falls short of the target of 10.96 percent set by the Ministry of Power.
