To boost domestic consumption of solar power, the Delhi cabinet decided that it will enter into agreements with housing societies and solar service providers to ensure domestic consumers bear no cost for the installation of solar panels. The agreement will build upon the generation-based incentive of 2 cents per unit on solar generation that the government had established under the Delhi Solar Policy -2016.
