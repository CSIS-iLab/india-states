The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) issued an order recognizing third-party investments in setting up solar roof top photo voltaic units. Under this model, a developer may operate solar plants and sell the energy generated to the consumer at retail supply tariffs fixed by KERC, before the energy is injected into the grid.
