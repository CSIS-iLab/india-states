Andhra Pradesh has become the thirteenth state to join the central government bailout scheme, Ujwal Assurance Discom Yojana (UDAY), for state power distribution companies. Andhra Pradesh’s participation in UDAY is expected to save the state $645 million. The center has also extended the deadline for states to sign up for UDAY to March 2017.
