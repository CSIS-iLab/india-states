Power distribution company BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd, a joint venture of Reliance Infrastructure and the government of Delhi, signed a deal to purchase 100 MW of wind power from the Power Trading Corp. The tariff set in the 25 year-deal is 5.4 cents a unit, the lowest in India. The power will be delivered through an inter-state transmission system that will source power from wind power projects in Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.
