In a bid to lower air pollution, the Maharashtra cabinet approved the Thermal Power Plant Ash Utilization Policy, which seeks to curb transport of fly ash produced in coal-based thermal plants and identifies measures to utilize coal waste at the source. The government has announced cluster development of ash-based industries, such as cement, in the vicinity of thermal power plants; the industries will be given land, ash, and tax incentives.
