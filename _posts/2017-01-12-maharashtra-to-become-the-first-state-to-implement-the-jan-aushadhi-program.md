Maharashtra looks set to be the first state in the country to implement the Jan Aushadhi program, making plans to open 600 state-run pharmacies selling generic medicines at State Transport depots. The stateâ€™s public health and transportation departments signed an MoU with the Bureau of Pharma Public Sector Utilities of India, an umbrella group representing state-owned pharmaceutical manufacturers. The central government has also allocated $20 million to build three more Food and Drugs Administration laboratories in the state.
