BSES Rajdhani Power Limited (BRPL), one of Delhi’s power distribution companies, launched the “Solar City Initiative” in partnership with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) PACE-D program and the German development bank, GIZ. Starting with 150 residential complexes in Dwarka, the initiative will allow for a single point in the entire complex for installation of solar rooftop systems.
