The central program to cut distribution company debt, the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), helped all but four of the 27 participating states and Union Territories reduce operating losses. Average aggregate transmission and commercial losses hit 20 percent, down from 25 percent the year the program started. Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab and Assam saw operating losses increase due to poor collection, high electricity theft, and low operational efficiency.
