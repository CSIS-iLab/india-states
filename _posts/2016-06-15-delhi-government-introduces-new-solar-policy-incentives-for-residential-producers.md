The Delhi government introduced a new solar energy policy that provides generation-based incentives to residential producers, promotes net metering and grid-connectivity for all solar plants, and exempts producers from electricity tax and VAT for solar energy units produced and solar energy-related equipment. The policy also makes it mandatory for public-sector buildings to install rooftop solar plants.
