Gujarat’s second attempt to auction projects at Raghanesda Solar Park generated tariffs that were substantially lower than the first sale in January, which had been canceled. French utility Engie got 200 MW in Thursday’s auction by bidding $0.037 per kWh, or unit. Gujarat State Electricity Corporation, Gujarat Energy Power Company, and Tata Power won 100 MW each at $0.038 per unit.
