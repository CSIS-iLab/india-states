Ranking 17th in the Anaemia Mukt Bharat 2019-20 index, Karnataka has been tasked with reducing its anaemia burden by 3 percent every year as part of the country’s goal for 2022. This can be achieved only by providing iron folic acid supplements to vulnerable groups — children, adolescents, and pregnant women — at regular intervals and ensuring project implementation.
