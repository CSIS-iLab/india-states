Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) ordered distribution companies not to sign any PPAs with wind power suppliers until further notice. The regulator is concerned that signing further PPAs will result in the state being on the hook to purchase more power than it needs. Karnataka has already signed enough PPAs with renewable energy developers to ensure it fulfills its renewable purchase obligation until 2020.
