The National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) has reversed its decision to cut power to Delhi distribution company BSES Yamuna Power Limited (BYPL) during the peak summer season after BYPL agreed to pay part of its debt by the end of March and committed to a payment plan for the remainder. BYPL owes $36.7 million to NTPC.
