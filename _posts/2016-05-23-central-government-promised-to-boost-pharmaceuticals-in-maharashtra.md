The central government has promised to boost the pharmaceuticals and plastic sectors in Maharashtra and approved six new research centers in the state that are expected to bring in $14 billion in investment. The state government has also signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs) with the national government to set up 100 centers for generic medicines under a scheme to provide cheaper medicines to the poor.
