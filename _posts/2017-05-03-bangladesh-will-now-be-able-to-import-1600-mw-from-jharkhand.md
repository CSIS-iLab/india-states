Bangladesh’s Cabinet Committee on Public Purchase has approved the import of electricity from a 1600 MW power plant in Jharkhand, India, even though per unit prices are higher than the norm. The Bangladeshi government had decided to import electricity from Jharkhand at a price of 8.6 US cents per unit for the next 25 years.
