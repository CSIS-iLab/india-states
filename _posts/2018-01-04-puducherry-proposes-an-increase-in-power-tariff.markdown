Starting April 2018, Puducherry Electricity Department (PED) is proposing an increase in tariff for domestic and other categories of consumers under the multi-year tariff (MYT) system. The tariff has been revised to bridge the revenue gap of $33 million from 2016-2019 and to earn additional revenue of $20 million.
