The Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) is facing a financial crisis due to a drought in the state and the failure to raise electricity tariffs. KSEB, which has been forced to reduce power production from hydroelectric sources and purchase power elsewhere, faces a shortfall of $10.7 million a day.
