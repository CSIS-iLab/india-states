The Andhra Pradesh cabinet approved the cancellation of the Polavaram hydropower project contract with Navayuga Engineering Company Ltd. (NECL), worth $448.3 million and called for new tenders with a reverse-tendering process. This comes after the High Courtâ€™s order to cancel the termination orders of NECL issued by the state government from taking up the project.
