Telangana has taken a number of steps to improve its position in national ease of doing business rankings: municipal bodies will now be able to provide building permissions to industries within 48 hours, and the state electricity department has adopted new computer control systems meant to reduce transmission and distribution losses. The government is also spending $356 million to improve its power infrastructure, including building substations and installing transformers.
