The Delhi government is reorganising public health facilities and introducing a new four-tiered structure, consisting of local (mohalla) clinics, multi-speciality clinics, multi-speciality hospitals, and super-speciality hospitals. The government allocated $32 million to establish 1,000 mohalla clinics.
