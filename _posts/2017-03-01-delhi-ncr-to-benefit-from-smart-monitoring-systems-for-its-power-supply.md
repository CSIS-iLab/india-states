BSES Yamuna Power Ltd., which supplies power to the National Capital Region, has deployed a system for smart monitoring of power supply that will cut fault restoration time by half. New sensors installed in the outage management system will be able to monitor the voltage profile and will allow the company to preempt faults and take preventive steps. The system will initially benefit about 100,000 customers and will be expanded to the entire region in phases.
