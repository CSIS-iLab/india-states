The National Thermal Power Corporation’s (NTPC) Kudgi plant began commercial production from the first of its planned three 800 MW units. The plant’s planned ultimate production capacity is 4,000 MW, but NTPC is considering obtaining the final 1,600 MW from solar power rather than thermal generation.
