The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy held discussions with state governments to find out how much land states would be willing to set aside for renewable energy parks, following a recent announcement by the ministry that it will ensure that land and transmission facilities are in place for developers who win wind and solar projects in auctions conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India.
