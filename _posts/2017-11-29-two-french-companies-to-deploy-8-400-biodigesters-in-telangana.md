Total S.A, the French oil and gas company, and GoodPlanet, a France-based NGO signed an agreement to deploy 8,400 biodigesters in Telangana in a bid to tackle climate change and provide clean energy to the state. The machines use fermentation to convert animal solid waste into cooking gas. The remainder can be used as fertilizer.
