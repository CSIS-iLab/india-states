Odishaâ€™s rooftop solar power pilot will now allow for net metering. Under the pilot program, introduced in August by the Odisha Electricity Regulatory Commission, consumers will not pay for any of the solar power produced by their rooftop panel as long as it does not surpass 90 percent of the total electricity consumed by the consumer annually.
