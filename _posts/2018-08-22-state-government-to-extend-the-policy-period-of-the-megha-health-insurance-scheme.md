Meghalaya health minister A L Hek said the state government has decided to extend the policy period of the Megha Health Insurance Scheme (MHIS-III) until October 1 this year. Once the policy period ends, the government will implement the new MHIS-IV, which had already been approved in convergence with the center's Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Swasthya Suraksha Mission or Ayushman Bharat.
