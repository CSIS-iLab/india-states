In an attempt to ensure that Indiaâ€™s efforts to revive work on the long-pending 2,000 megawatts (MW) Lower Subansiri project in Arunachal Pradesh avoid derailment, Assam has constituted a high-power state level task force to facilitate work on the strategic project. The state has also launched a committee comprising of deputy commissioners and superintendent of police of the trouble prone districts of Tezpur, Sonitpur, Biswanath, Dhemaji, and Lakhimpur.
