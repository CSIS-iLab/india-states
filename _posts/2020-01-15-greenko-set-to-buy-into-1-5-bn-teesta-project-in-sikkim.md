Greenko will purchase part of Teesta Stage III in Sikkim, the largest private hydroelectric project in Asia, sources said. The transaction will increase the operating renewable portfolio of Greenko to 6.2 gigawatts and give an exit to the projectâ€™s original investors, who spent $425 million to bankroll this high-profile venture in 2010.
