The Centre for Digital Financial Inclusion (CDFI), New Delhi and Aga Khan Academy, Hyderabad have signed an MOU to roll out a digital inclusion pilot called Benefit Entitlement Tracking Solution (BETS) at 45 local maternal and child health centers in Mahbubnagar district. BETS will introduce digital records to ensure that those entitled to benefits receive them while reducing administrative load.
