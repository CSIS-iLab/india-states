Andhra Pradesh has announced plans to expand its solar energy projects on the Losari Canal. The government has commissioned a 600 kilowatt (KW) solar panel project that will cover the canal with solar panels in addition to the 400 KW that began operation in 2015. Solar panels will also be used to cover parts of the Polavaram Right main canal.
