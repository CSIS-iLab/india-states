The state energy regulator confirmed must-run status for power generated from renewable energy sources. The Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) ordered that generation from renewable sources be subject to scheduling, not merit order dispatch (uptake according to cheapest source). MPERC had earlier released a draft order requiring merit order dispatch for all sources of energy.
