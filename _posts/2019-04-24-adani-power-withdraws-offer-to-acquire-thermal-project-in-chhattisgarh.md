Adani Power withdrew its offer to acquire the KSK Mahanadi thermal project in Chhattisgarh. The decision came after Adani stated that the acquisition was unviable after the Uttar Pradesh Power Corporation, which is one of KSKâ€™s key customers, has decided to reduce tariffs for the procurement of electricity.
