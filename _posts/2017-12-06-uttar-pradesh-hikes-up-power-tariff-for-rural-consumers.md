The Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) hiked the power tariff for metered rural consumers by 4 cents per unit for the first 100 units and 7 cents per unit thereafter.  Unmetered rural customers will be required to install a meter or pay $10 per month, up from $2.80. Below poverty line consumers, who used to receive 150 subsidized units per month, will now receive 100 units.
