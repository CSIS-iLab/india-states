Telangana has signed an agreement with Microsoft India to adopt cloud-based analytics solution for the state’s child health screening program. It will use Microsoft Intelligent Network for Eyecare, an artificial intelligence platform that uses big data and research insights from U.S. and Indian institutions, to screen children for vision issues.
