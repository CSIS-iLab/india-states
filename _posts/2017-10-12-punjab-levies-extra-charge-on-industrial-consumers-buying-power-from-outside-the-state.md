The Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) has levied an additional open access surcharge of 1 cent per kWh on industrial consumers, a move aimed at discouraging industrial consumers from purchasing power outside the state. Industrial units with connections of greater than 1 MW capacity are allowed to buy electricity from outside the state, which is often cheaper.
