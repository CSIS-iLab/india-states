Prime Minister Modi said the $1.8 billion project to revive the Talcher fertilizer plant will, for the first time, convert coal into gas for use as feedstock and for producing neem-coated urea. He also stated that the project, which will start production in 36 months, will help cut import of natural gas and fertilizer and make India self-reliant.
