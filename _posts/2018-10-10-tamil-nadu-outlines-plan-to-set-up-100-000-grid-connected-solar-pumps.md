The Tamil Nadu Energy Development Agency, the nodal agency for renewable energy in the state, has outlined a plan to roll out 100,000 grid-connected solar powered agriculture pumps at a project cost of $1.87 billion. The project aims to incentivise farmers generating solar power and help them earn additional income by selling excess power to the grid, while reducing the subsidy burden for the state government.
