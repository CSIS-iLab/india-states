The Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) has proposed to cap the tariff for solar power generated by roof-top plants at 50 percent of the lowest price paid to solar power generation firms and to tax power generated by rooftop solar panels. TANGEDCO maintains that the move is necessary to save money in the context of its high operating deficit.
