Mizoram signed an MOU with the central government to join the Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana (UDAY), the central bailout scheme for indebted state distribution utilities. The center estimates that Mizoram will save $30 million through access to cheaper debt, reduction in transmission and commercial losses, and improved efficiency.
