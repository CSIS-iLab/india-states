The Union government directed Coastal Tamil Nadu Power Limited to apply for new clearances for a 4,000 MW Ultra Mega Thermal Power Project in Kancheepuram, Tamil Nadu. The decision comes after the company was denied clearances by the Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change in February 2019.
