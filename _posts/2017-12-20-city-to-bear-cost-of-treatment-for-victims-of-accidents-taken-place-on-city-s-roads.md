The Delhi cabinet approved a proposal for the city to bear the cost of treatment at private hospitals for victims of motor accidents, fire, and acid attacks that take place on the city's roads. There will be no upper cap on the cost per patient. The proposal will now be sent to Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal for his approval.
