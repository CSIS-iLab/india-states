Orange Renewable, a subsidiary of Singapore-based AT Holdings, has secured a 200 MW wind power project in Tamil Nadu following a competitive auction conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India. The company’s bid of 4.1 cents per unit is the lowest tariff ever discovered in India and one of the lowest in the world.
