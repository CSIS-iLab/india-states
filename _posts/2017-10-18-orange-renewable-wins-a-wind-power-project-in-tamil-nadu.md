Orange Renewable, a subsidiary of Singapore-based AT Holdings, has secured a 200 MW wind power project in Tamil Nadu following a competitive auction conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India. The companyâ€™s bid of 4.1 cents per unit is the lowest tariff ever discovered in India and one of the lowest in the world.
