Andhra Pradesh’s electricity distribution companies (discoms) have asked the state power regulator to unilaterally lower the per-unit tariff in the state’s power purchase agreements (PPAs) for wind energy. The discoms signed PPAs for wind power generators in 2015 at prices between 7.3 and 7.4 cents per unit. Two years later, however, bids in other tenders have fallen as low as 5.3 cents per unit.
