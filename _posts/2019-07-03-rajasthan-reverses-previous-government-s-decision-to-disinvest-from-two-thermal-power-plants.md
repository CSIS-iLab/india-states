The Rajasthan government reversed the previous BJP governmentâ€™s decision to disinvest the Kali Sindh and Chhabra power plants. While the previous government had decided to disinvest from the plants in order to reduce the losses of state power companies, the Rajasthan state cabinet reversed the decision following improvements in operational efficiency and financial condition of the thermal power plants.
