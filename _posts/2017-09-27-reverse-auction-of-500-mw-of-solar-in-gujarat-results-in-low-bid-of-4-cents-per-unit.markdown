A reverse auction of 500 megawatts (MW) of solar capacity by the Gujarat government discovered a low bid of 4 cents per kilowatt hour (kwH). This was the first solar auction held since May’s record-setting auction for Rajasthan’s Bhadla Solar Park, which saw a record-low tariff of 3 cents per kwH. Gujarat is less favorable for solar power than Rajasthan, and solar producers will have to obtain land for the plants.
