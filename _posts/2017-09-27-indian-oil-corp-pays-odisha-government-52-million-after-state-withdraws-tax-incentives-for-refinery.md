State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) said it has paid $52 million to the Odisha government under a settlement reached after the state withdrew tax incentives for the Paradip refinery project. Last month, the state government agreed to give IOC a $107.8 million interest-free loan each year for 15 years to make up for the stateâ€™s cancellation of an 11-year deferment on payment of sales tax refinery products sold in the state.
