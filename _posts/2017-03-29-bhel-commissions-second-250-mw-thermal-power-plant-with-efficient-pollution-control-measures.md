Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL) has successfully commissioned the second 250 megawatt (MW) unit of a coal-based power plant at Bhavnagar. The unit uses eco-friendly Circulating Fluidized Bed Combustion technology, which can reabsorb up to 95 percent of pollutants before they are released into the atmosphere. The additional capacity comes as Gujarat’s four state-owned coal-based power plants recorded a capacity utilization of only 41 percent in 2016; due to the high cost of coal, the plants were not able to produce power cheaply enough to justify first-run status
