Andhra Pradesh has refused to sign power purchase agreements for wind power with tariffs higher than that reached at India’s first ever wind power auction. The state’s power regulator had set wind tariffs at over 7 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh), but the auction, completed in February, produced a tariff of 5 cents per kWh.
