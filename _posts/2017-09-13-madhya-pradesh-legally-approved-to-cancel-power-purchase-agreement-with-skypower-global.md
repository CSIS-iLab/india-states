The Madhya Pradesh government won its legal fight to cancel all PPAs with SkyPower Global, a Canada-based solar power company. The state government also attempted to do the same to contracts with ReNew Power, which has gone to court to enforce the contracts. The state alleged that SkyPower had failed to procure the land necessary for the solar park by the stipulated date.
