The West Bengal state assembly passed three important bills. First, the Clinical Establishments Bill, which gives the state power to monitor private healthcare institutions and to impose penalties in case of violations. The bill requires private healthcare providers to accept and treat patients in cases of acid attack, rape, or accidents. Second, a bill amending the West Bengal Agricultural Produce (Regulation) Act, 1972 to create a single license for trading in all markets within the state. Third, - the West Bengal Municipal (Amendment) Bill, 2017, which empowers executive officers of urban local bodies to take on additional responsibilities in order to provide better civic services.
