Tamil Nadu has launched a scheme to sell LED lights at subsidized rates via designated sale points such as electricity bill payment centers. Nine watt LED bulbs will be sold for $1, 43 percent of the market price, at 60 places in Chennai, with plans to expand throughout the state. LED tube lights and energy efficient fans will also be sold at subsidized rates. Tamil Nadu aims to distribute 30 million LED bulbs, 3.5 million LED tubelights, and 1 million fans, at a total estimated annual electricity savings of 41.6 million kilowatt-hours.
