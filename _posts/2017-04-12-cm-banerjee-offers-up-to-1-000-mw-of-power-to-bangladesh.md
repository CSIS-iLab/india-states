Although she forestalled any agreement on the Teesta River water-sharing issue, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee offered Bangladesh up to 1,000 MW of electricity during her meeting with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Bangladesh currently buys 500 MW of electricity from West Bengal and 100 MW from Tripura.
