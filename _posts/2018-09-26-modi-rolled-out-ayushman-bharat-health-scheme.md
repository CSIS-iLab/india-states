Prime Minister Narendra Modi rolled out the ambitious Ayushman Bharat health scheme aimed at providing $6,920 in medical coverage to 500 million Indians. However, five states and union territories ruled by opposition parties – Telangana, Delhi, Odisha, Kerala, and Punjab – refused to implement the program.
