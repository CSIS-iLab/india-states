Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced free electricity for more than 1.2 million farmers for up to $135 for a year on their agricultural electricity connection, starting in November 2018. The scheme will be implemented through Direct Benefit Transfer grants, which will reimburse farmers up to a maximum amount of $11.2 per month after they first pay the bill.
