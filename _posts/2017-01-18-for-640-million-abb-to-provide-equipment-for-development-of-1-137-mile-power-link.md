Swiss transformer manufacturer ABB won a $640 million contract to provide equipment for a 1,137-mile power link in India to connect thermal and wind power plants with the country’s growing urban areas, with its terminus in Tamil Nadu. The ultra-high-voltage 800 kilovolt system will have its other terminus at Raigarh.
