Haryana’s two power distribution companies (discoms) have decided to correlate power supply hours per day with the transmission and distribution losses of different feeder stations, effectively cutting power for two to eight hours per day in areas where power theft and non-payment of electricity bills are most frequent. The discoms are struggling with total debt of $5.4 billion.
