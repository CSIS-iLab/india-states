As part of the center’s bailout scheme for state power distribution companies (discoms), the Finance Ministry has given permission to Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to issue bonds to cover discom debt. Discoms in these four states owe around $22.4 billion, which represents about 35 percent of the outstanding loans of all state discoms.
