Tamil Nadu’s 500 MW wind energy auction, the first ever conducted by an Indian state, generated a record low tariff of 5 cents per unit. The lowest bidders in the sale by Tamil Nadu were ReGenPowertech, Leap Green Energy, and public sector mining giant Neyveli Lignite Corp., which offered 5 cents per unit for the entire 500 MW.
