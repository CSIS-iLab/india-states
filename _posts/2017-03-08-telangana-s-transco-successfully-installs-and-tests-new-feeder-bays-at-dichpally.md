Telangana Transco announced the successful installation and test charge of two new feeder bays at the Dichpally substation, the final step necessary before Telangana can begin to receive power from Chhattisgarh. Telanganaâ€™s two discoms are set to get 1,000 MW of electricity beginning in the middle of March.
