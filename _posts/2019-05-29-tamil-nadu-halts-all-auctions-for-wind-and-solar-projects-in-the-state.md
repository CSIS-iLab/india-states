Tamil Nadu, one of Indiaâ€™s biggest renewable energy producing states, announced it will stop conducting auctions for wind and solar energy projects following poor response to its tenders which set limits on tariffs. Instead, it will buy clean power from the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) to fulfil its Renewable Purchase Obligation.
