Punjab became the first state in the country to introduce an injection safety program. Supported by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics and the World Health Organization, Punjab will introduce syringes that can only be used once and will provide hospitals with rapid hepatitis C test kits to screen high risk patients.
