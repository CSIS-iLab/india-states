The Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) has endorsed a wind energy power purchase agreement (PPA) at the original tariff of 7 cents per unit, ending a month-long dispute with the state government. The move kindled hopes that the state would begin executing older PPAs despite the steep fall in tariffs discovered in recent auctions. KERCâ€™s chairman, however, said that the commission would evaluate PPAs on a case-by-case basis.
