Chief Minister Nitish Kumar announced that the state government will provide direct power subsidies to consumers to reduce the impact of new tariff hikes. The chief ministerâ€™s statement came six days after Bihar Electricity Regulatory Commission (BERC) announced a 55 percent increase in power tariffs. Consumers will still see their tariffs go up by 20 percent. BERC had not raised tariffs since 2011.
