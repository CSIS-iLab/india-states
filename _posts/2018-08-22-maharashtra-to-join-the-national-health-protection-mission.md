The Maharashtra government wrote to the center stating that has taken an "in-principle" decision to join the National Health Protection Mission (NHPM). Maharashtra had earlier cited financial constraints following the $3.14 billion farm loan waiver as hurdles to joining the government's flagship health program aimed at providing health coverage to 107.4 million families across the country.
