Despite four extensions to the bidding deadline, a solar tender for one gigawatt or solar power has yet again failed to attract developers, prompting only two bids for a total 300 megwatts (MW) of capacity. The auction stipulated a maximum rate of $0.039 (Rs2.75) per kWh for electricity generated by the plants.
