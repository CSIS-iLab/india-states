Delhiâ€™s power department has opened registration for rooftop solar power plants in the city. Residential, institutional, and social sector consumers are eligible to install rooftop plants that can sell solar back to the grid. Delhi hopes to use one gigawatt of energy from renewable sources by 2020.
