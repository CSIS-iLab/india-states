Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar announced a new policy under which domestic power connections in any rural area of the state will require an up-front payment of just $3. The balance of the cost, $43 to $58, can be paid in installments of $1.50 to $3. Currently consumers have to pay the entire cost up front.
