The state-run Odisha Power Generation Corporation (OPGC) requires 24,000 metric tons of coal daily to run its four units, but due to local agitations at mines in Odisha, the Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd is providing only 14,000 metric tons of coal to OPGC. Because of this coal shortage, authorities of OPGC decided to shut one of its units.
