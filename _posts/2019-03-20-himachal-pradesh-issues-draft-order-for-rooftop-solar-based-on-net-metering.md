The Himachal Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission issued a draft order for rooftop solar grid-interactive systems based on net metering. This order will apply to those domestic consumers who have a letter of approval to install rooftop solar PV grid-interactive systems based on net metering issued after November 15, 2018, and who have subsequently installed these systems.
