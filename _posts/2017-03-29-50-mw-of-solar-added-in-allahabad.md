The Uttar Pradesh New and Renewable Energy Agency (UPNEDA) has begun construction of a 50 MW solar park on 250 acres in the Allahabad district. UPNEDA has also approved rooftop solar panels for several institutions in the district; owners of rooftop panels will be able to sell the electricity they produce back to the stateâ€™s northern grid.
