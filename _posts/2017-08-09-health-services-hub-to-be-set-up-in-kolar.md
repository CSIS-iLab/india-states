Karnataka signed an agreement with Tata Trusts and Tata Consultancy Services to set up a health services hub in Kolar that will use digital technologies to ensure that district residents receive benefits under Universal Health Coverage; digitize patient records; and increase use of primary care centers by 50 percent. The state government has agreed to provide the physical infrastructure and manpower to deliver services.
