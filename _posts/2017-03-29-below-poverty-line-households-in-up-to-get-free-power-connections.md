Union Power Minister Piyush Goyal and newly installed Uttar Pradesh Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma have decided to provide all below poverty line households in Uttar Pradesh with free power connections. The state will also offer amnesty to households and businesses that are currently using illegal power connections if they sign up for legal connections.
