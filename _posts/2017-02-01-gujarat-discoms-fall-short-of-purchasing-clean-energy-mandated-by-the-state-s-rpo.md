Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd.’s (GUVNL) four affiliated distribution companies fell short of purchasing required renewable energy in 2015-16 on account of low supply of power from wind and other renewable energy sources. Under the state’s Renewable Purchase Obligation (RPO), a distribution company is mandated to buy 9 percent of electricity from renewable energy (7 percent from wind, 1.5 percent from solar and 0.5 percent from other sources). GUVNL procured only 7.66 percent from renewable energy sources in 2015-16.
