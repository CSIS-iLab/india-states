The Maharashtra Cabinet agreed to implement the central government’s Deendayal Upadhyaya Gramjyoti Yojana (DDUGJY) and its Integrated Power Development Scheme (IPDS), in a bid to strengthen rural and urban electrification networks. Maharashtra expects to electrify two thirds of the remaining 190,000 households without power.
