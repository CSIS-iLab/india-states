Canadian Solar has signed 25-year power purchase agreements with the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) for an aggregate 80 MW of solar power projects in Maharashtra. Canadian Solar was originally awarded the projects via a competitive auction; the benchmark tariff was set at 6.6 cents per kilowatt hour. The projects are due to start operations in late 2017.
