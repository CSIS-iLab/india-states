The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority submitted a new plan for air pollution control in the Delhi area to the Supreme Court. The plan calls for a reduction in pollutants by up to 76 percent. The Centre for Environment and Energy Development reported that Delhi did not experience a single “good” air quality day throughout the recent winter.
