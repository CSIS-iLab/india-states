The Biocon Foundation signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Karnataka Health and Family Welfare Department to establish ‘eLAJ’ smart clinics in 15 primary healthcare centers across six districts. The clinics are equipped with a multi-parameter monitoring device which enables multiple diagnostic tests and generation of electronic medical records of patients.
