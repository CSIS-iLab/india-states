The Himachal Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission set generic tariffs for solar photovoltaic (PV) projects at between $0.057 and $0.058 (Rs. 3.94 to Rs. 4.06) per kWh. This tariff rate will be applicable in cases where the joint petition for the approval of a PPA has been submitted to the HPERC on or after April 1, 2019, but not later than September 30, 2019, and also those solar PV projects that have been commissioned on or before March 31, 2021.
