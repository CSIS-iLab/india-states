Steel giant ArcelorMittal is seeking the state governmentâ€™s permission to build a 600 megawatt (MW) solar plant on a site that was originally meant for a steel mill with the capacity to produce six million metric tons per year. ArcelorMittal cited steel overcapacity worldwide and the uncertainty of iron ore availability in the area as reasons for the change.
