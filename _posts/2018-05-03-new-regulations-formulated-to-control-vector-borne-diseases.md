The State Government has formulated new regulations to control vector-borne diseases. The Odisha Epidemic Diseases (Malaria, Dengue and Japanese Encephalitis) Regulations, 2018 aims at monitoring the management of diseases. The new regulations prescribe procedures to be followed in case of suspicion and confirmed cases; doctors in government health institutions and registered practitioners in private hospitals or clinics are required to get the blood slides prepared for each case of fever reported apart from the currently adopted procedure of Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) for malaria.
