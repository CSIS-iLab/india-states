The Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission has recently approved a petition filed by two discoms seeking the installation of grid-connected solar-powered pumps in the state. The pilot project will involve the installation of 468 such solar pumps, with a combined generational capacity amounting to 2.9 megawatts (MW) and is expected to receive a 30 percent subsidy through the central governmentâ€™s KUSUM program.
