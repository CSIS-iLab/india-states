The Kerala State Electricity Board announced it will implement a new system to completely avoid power failure. With this, power supply will be assured through two sources in all rural and urban areas, so that a second feeder can ensure power supply in case of supply interruption from the first source. The project will be completed by 2021 and will include the construction of new high tension lines, installation of transformers in load centers and replacement of damaged electricity lines.
