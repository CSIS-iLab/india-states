The Assam Power Generation Corporation Limited (APGCL) has retendered 70 MW of grid-connected solar projects to be developed at Amguri Solar Park in Sivasagar district of the state. The tender was initially floated in January 2019. “The response from the developers was poor due to the upper tariff cap of $0.0049 per unit, or kilowatt-hour (kWh). We have now revised the ceiling to $0.0056 per kWh,” an APGCL official said.
