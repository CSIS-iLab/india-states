Odisha Thermal Power Corporationâ€™s (OTPC) planned 2,400 MW coal-based power plant reached an impasse as OTPC fears the coal block assigned by the Ministry of Coal (MoC) will be too expensive to exploit. The Ministry of coal had allocated the Tentuloi coal block, with reserves of 1.3 billion tons. But Tentuloi is an underground block and poses the risk of escalating the cost of power production.
