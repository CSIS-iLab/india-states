Rajasthan has become the third state to sign a memorandum of understanding to join the central governmentâ€™s state electricity utility revival scheme. Under the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY) scheme, the Rajasthan government will take over $8.9 billion of the debt on the books of the electricity distribution utilities.
