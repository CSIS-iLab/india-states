Power distribution company Tata Power Delhi Distribution Limited (DDL) has implemented a microgrid project in Bihar’s Tayabpur village, which has an estimated 190 dwellings with a population of around 1000. The project is in line with the central government’s electrification program, which aims to provide “electricity to all” by establishing a standalone off-grid village electrification system where grid supply has not reached or is not feasible. For the project, Tata Power-DDL has been supported by partners including TataTrusts, MIT, Prayas Juvenile Aid Centre, and General Electric.
