Andhra Pradesh has become the thirteenth state to join the central government bailout scheme, Ujwal Assurance Discom Yojana (UDAY), for state power distribution companies. Andhra Pradeshâ€™s participation in UDAY is expected to save the state $645 million. The center has also extended the deadline for states to sign up for UDAY to March 2017.
