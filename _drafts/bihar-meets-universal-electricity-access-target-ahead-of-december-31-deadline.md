All households in the state of Bihar have been provided with electricity connections, irrespective of their location, two months ahead of the December 31 deadline for universal household electrification under the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana, or Saubhagya scheme. Power Minister R.K. Singh, a lawmaker from Arrah, Bihar, has been credited for this exercise.
