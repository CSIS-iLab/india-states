To promote solar projects in the city, the Delhi government will pay $0.029 for each unit of solar energy produced by domestic solar panel owners and charitable organizations and will also waive the mandatory certification of solar projects for projects up to 200 kW. This incentive will be funded by Delhi government’s “air ambience fund” created from a $0.004 tax on each liter of diesel bought in the city.
