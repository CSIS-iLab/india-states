Telangana has told the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) that it is willing to buy electricity generated by the NTPC for use by Delhi which the national capital doesn’t require. The move would save Delhi residents the fixed costs they are liable to pay under Delhi’s contract with the NTPC, translating into a savings of one cent per unit.
