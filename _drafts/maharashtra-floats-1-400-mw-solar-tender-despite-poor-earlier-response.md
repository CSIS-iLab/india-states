Despite receiving poor response for a 1,000 MW distributed generation power tender, the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited has floated another tender for purchase of 1,400MW. In its earlier 1,000 MW tender, it had received bids for only 287 MW of the total amount, with the highest tariff quoted at 4 cents/kWh.
