The Madhya Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (MPERC) has amended regulations for co-generation and generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. As part of the amendment, MPERC has defined “captive renewable energy generation source” as a project set up by any person to generate electricity primarily for his own use and includes a project set up by any co-operative society or association.
