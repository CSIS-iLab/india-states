The Badarpur thermal power station will be permanently shut down on October 15, and will be replaced by a substation in Tughlakabad, which will be commissioned by the end of the month. The Badarpur power station was the national capital’s biggest power generator for over 45 years and the contributor of 11 percent of the deadly ultrafine particulate matter in the city’s air.
