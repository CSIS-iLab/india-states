The Madhya Pradesh government has approved a rooftop solar power policy that provides incentives to consumers who install small solar power systems. For systems manufactured in India, the state will provide residential consumers a 30 percent subsidy and government buildings a 45-50 percent subsidy. Surplus electricity will be adjusted against consumption.
