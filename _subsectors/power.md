Indiaâ€™s power sector is entering a new era of surplus generation, yet its distribution companies are still hobbled by crippling debt. Transmission networks continue to expand, bringing electricity access to the far corners of the country while preparing to integrate vast quantities of power generated through renewable energy sources. Central and state governments share responsibility for providing electricity. States set electricity tariffs and have considerable freedom in allocating subsidies to power producers. In this section we highlight major reforms in the power sector, such as the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), investments in power sector infrastructure, alternative models for power monitoring and distribution, and policies affecting electricity tariffs.
