Authority over nuclear power lies with the central government, but only states have the power to acquire the land for the plants themselves. In addition, state-level politics can delay the siting and construction of proposed plants. India thus depends on state-level openness to nuclear power, and state policies on land acquisition, to meet its target of expanding its civil nuclear capacity to 60 GW.
