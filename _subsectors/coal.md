The coal sector in India has had a dramatic turnaround; from an era of mismanagement and opacity, to one of greater transparency in allocation of coal blocks and improvements in management and technologies used to mine and process raw material. These reforms have boosted domestic production to the point that India is nearly self-sufficient in coal. Despite this turnaround, however, weak power demand, the central governmentâ€™s commitment to renewable energy, and political meddling in electricity tariffs continues to threaten the sector. This section examines the coal sector in terms of renewable energy expansion, commitment to super critical technologies, the commissioning of new plants in some states, and economic hurdles in other states.
