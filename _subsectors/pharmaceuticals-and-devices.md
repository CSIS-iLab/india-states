Within the last several years, India has become a major hub for the development and supply of pharmaceutical and medical device due to the low costs of resources and labor. However, with such a boom comes a significant need to regulate the quality management of this industry. While all drugs manufactured in India require a license, the licensing process differs state to state. Important medical devices found in developed nations tend to be too expensive for Indiaâ€™s medical clinics and can struggle to operate under frequent power outages, lack of climate controls, and other environmental factors.
