Currently, the number of medical professionals available per 10,000 citizens in India is barely half of the World Health Organization’s suggested norm. This shortage is one of the main causes of the gaps in access to healthcare experienced by the public who struggle to find specialists for their medical conditions. In addition, a higher density of healthcare workers is found in urban regions than in rural regions exasperating this issue for citizens who live outside major cities.
