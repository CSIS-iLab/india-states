    that they need to achieve in order for India as a whole to reach 60 GW of wind
    power by 2022. State targets are based on their potential to produce wind power,
    including land area, geographical location and achievable wind velocity, and thus
    vary widely. This map represents state wind capacity target as a percentage of
    the national target for each of the eight states. Kerala, which has an installed
    wind capacity of over 50 MW, has not been assigned any wind capacity target by
    the central government.

    The eight states that have been assigned wind power capacity targets are Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Telangana.

    This chart tracks the progress each state has made towards reaching its own target for wind power capacity.

In 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi set a goal of reaching 60 GW of wind power generation capacity by 2022. In order to achieve this ambitious target, eight state governments were identified to increase their rate of wind capacity growth. The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has assigned each of these eight states a wind capacity target. The Indian States Wind Energy Performance Tracker is a tool to monitor the progress states have made in reaching this target.
