*Engaging Indian States* is a knowledge portal which tracks significant developments in India’s states and provides context and analysis. While the focus of international engagement with India has been primarily been the central government, the trajectory of India’s economic growth is dependent on the actions and vision of its state governments.
 
*Engaging Indian States* is a comprehensive tool for businesses, research institutions, policymakers, and journalists who seek greater insight into the potential for engagement with India’s subnational governments. This portal will help readers to follow state policy and regulatory changes in key sectors identified as critical to India’s growth. In its first phase the site will focus on the performance of state governments in the energy sector, a critical lynchpin of India’s development ambitions.
 
The website has two ways to sort the information: by state, or by sector. If you wish to see all data on an individual state, please select that state from the drop-down menu. If you are interested to learn about all developments in an individual sector across all 29 states, select that sector from the menu.
