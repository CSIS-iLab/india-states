# India’s State-Level Reforms, First Quarter 2020: COVID-19 stalls momentum on state reforms

The first quarter of 2020 has been a tumultuous period for Indian states. States grappling with fiscal uncertainty at the start of the quarter mobilized state budgets to discharge a wide range of populist to pro-business measures. With 21 affirmative reforms in tow, states had set the ball rolling to revive the subnational business climate. However, the turn of events following the outbreak of the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the subsequent nation-wide lockdown has brought the states’ economy to a halt.

While state governments across the country are committing upfront investments to address the pandemic fallout, there remains a considerable variation in the subnational response due to regional politics and institutional capacity. States are stepping up in using the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to reform. For instance, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana have incentivized online payments of electricity bills, resulting in cash-flow relief to the distribution utilities.

Key developments were prompted before the [lockdown was implemented](https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/Guidelines.pdf) on March 24,2020. States were deploying strategies to attract investments in the industrial sector with special attention to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME), and start-ups. Four states unveiled plans to improve the MSME landscape. Additionally, Madhya Pradesh approved an act to fast-track investment approvals. Jammu & Kashmir multiple incentives and sanctioned sectoral policies to boost industrial growth while grappling with [political uncertainties](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/preparing-for-a-new-political-field-in-jk/article31382917.ece).

The quarter also ushered in optimism on climate change. Odisha lead the way by introducing a climate budget to track mitigation activities. Three more states launched measures to steer environmental conservation. In addition, a slew of reforms were actioned in land regulations. Madhya Pradesh topped a survey assessing the extent of digitization of land records and their quality across 30 states, and Uttarakhand became the first state to implement agriculture leasing policy. As may be expected from state budgets, two states and Delhi introduced electricity subsidies to light up political fortunes.

Finally, in tracking the state-level reforms this quarter, we applaud two subnational agencies for turning the tide on business negative reforms. In a much-needed relief for the clean energy developers, the Andhra Pradesh Electricity Regulator directed the state electricity utilities to honour their power purchase agreements. Separately, the central electricity supply utility of Odisha will start disconnecting consumers who have not made payments despite multiple notices. We hope that more utilities follow suit.

The spread of COVID-19 continues to have a profound effect on multiple dimensions. As the scale of crisis emerges, Indian states should stay the course and tackle the challenges of economic slowdown whilst containing the virus. Any revival of the momentum of reforms is unlikely anytime soon.
