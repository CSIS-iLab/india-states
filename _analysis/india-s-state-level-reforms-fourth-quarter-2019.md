As we close out 2019, India’s mantra of “competitive federalism” to encourage state-level business reforms barely has a pulse. The Indian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has not updated its rankings of Indian states through the “Business Reforms Action Plan,” since 2017. However, even without a visible push from New Delhi, states continue to move forward with smart reforms to improve their business environment. The fourth quarter saw a very high number of significant, positive state-level business reforms — 23 in all.

Karnataka was the most active state with four positive business reforms. However, it also took a step that will harm its business attractiveness by forcing private firms to prioritize hiring native Kannadigas. Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan had three positive reforms each. Gujarat and Kerala had two each. And nine other states had one positive reform each.

Reform areas prioritized by states in the fourth quarter of the year resembled reforms from the third quarter of 2019. States continue to move forward with policies to incentivize the adoption of renewable energy and electric vehicles. Five states amended or created new industrial policies to boost manufacturing. Six states adopted policies to encourage development of renewable energy with two focusing on rooftop solar. Three states adopted policies to strengthen the startup environment. While many states talk about “single window clearances” for establishing a new business, Kerala and Gujarat both moved to “zero window clearance”, allowing firms to operate up to three years without permits.

Political affiliation seems to be largely irrelevant for implementing reforms. Among the five states with multiple reforms, two are run by Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) chief ministers; two by Congress chief ministers; and one by a third party.

Elections stalled reforms, as was seen in Maharashtra, Haryana, and Jharkhand which held elections in this period. Although, Haryana did adopt new net metering provisions to its rooftop solar policy just after its voting day. More troubling is that the Shiv Sena-led government in Maharashtra has [spooked investors](https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/bullet-train-goes-off-track-so-does-investor-interest/1786880/) by threatening to cancel a range of contracts signed by the previous government including a high-speed railway project supported by the government of Japan. A similar story of policy instability continues to play out in Andhra Pradesh following the spring 2019 election that brought the YSR Congress to power.

Surprisingly, despite [growing evidence](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/economicsurvey/doc/vol1chapter/echap03_vol1.pdf) in favor of increasing the workforce-size trigger for the Industrial Disputes Act, no additional states have taken the difficult step of amending this key law since Assam in [2017](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/business/economy/huawei-restrictions.html). Though Karnataka did add labor flexibility this quarter, passing a new regulation to allow female workers to handle night shifts in factories.
