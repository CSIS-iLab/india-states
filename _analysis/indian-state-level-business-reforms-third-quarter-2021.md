After a slow start to 2021, Indian states accelerated the pace of business reforms during the third quarter of the year. Importantly, many states focused on reforms that are sector-agnostic. Instead of this approach, Indian states should choose important structural reforms related to land acquisition, industrial approvals, and reduced compliances that will help companies in a range of sectors.   
   
The central government was quite active in encouraging and supporting state-level reforms. The Ministry of Power announced a new bailout package for states’ broken electric power utilities and a new government division to track states’ compliance with regulations. Additionally, the Ministry of Commerce & Industry is trying to deepen its push toward a true single-window clearance for businesses by including nearly one-third of Indian states on its new single-window portal.   
   
In the third quarter of 2021, Telangana led the way with four significant business policy reforms; Haryana was just behind with three reforms. Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Jammu & Kashmir had two positive reforms each, and five other states enacted a single reform each to help boost industrial growth and job creation.   
   
As usual, not all the news is positive. Ahead of its state election, Uttar Pradesh blocked an attempt by the state electricity distribution company to increase rates, and Jharkhand followed in other states’ steps by adopting a stringent local employment regulation for private industry.
