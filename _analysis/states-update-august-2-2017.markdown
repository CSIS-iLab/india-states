**Centerâ€“State relations**

The central program to cut distribution company debt, the Ujwal Discom Assurance Yojana (UDAY), helped all but four of the 27 participating states and Union Territories reduce operating losses. Average aggregate transmission and commercial losses hit 20 percent, down from 25 percent the year the program started. Karnataka, Kerala, Punjab and Assam saw operating losses increase due to poor collection, high electricity theft, and low operational efficiency. **Source:** [Deccan Herald](http://www.deccanherald.com/content/625446/uday8200helped-up-discoms-profit-ktaka.html)

**Bihar**

Chief Minister Nitish Kumar unexpectedly resigned his position, only to return as chief minister the next day after forming a new coalition with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The move forced Kumar's previous coalition partner, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), into the opposition. Relations between Kumar and RJD leader Lalu Yadav had foundered over accusations of corruption in Yadav's family. Kumar inducted three BJP ministers into his cabinet. **Source:** [Economic Times](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/nitish-kumar-to-be-back-as-bihar-cm-swearing-in-today-at-10-am/articleshow/59784667.cms), [Economic Times](http://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/nitish-kumar-distributes-portfolios-among-newly-inducted-ministers/59829167)
