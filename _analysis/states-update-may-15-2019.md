Meghalaya faces a severe power crisis; Kerala announces new plan to ensure power supply through two sources for all rural and urban areas in the state; a one-gigawatt tender in Gujarat fails to attract developers despite four deadline extensions; Rajasthan announces funding for 30 start-ups in the state; CERC passes order regarding the imposition of safeguard duty on import of solar cells; and more.

**Center – State relations**

The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC) proposed setting the national average power purchase cost at $0.051 (Rs. 3.60) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for open access for FY 2019-20. The proposal is open to comments up to May 28, 2019. **Source:** [Mercom](https://mercomindia.com/cerc-proposes-%E2%82%B93-60-kwh-as-national-average-power-purchase-cost-for-open-access/) **In detail:** [Calculation of Average Power Purchase Cost (APPC) at the national level](http://www.cercind.gov.in/2019/orders/05-SM-2019.pdf)

In a landmark judgment, power sector regulator CERC held that the imposition of safeguard duty on imports of solar cells and modules amounts to a “change in law” event for the developers who must be compensated for the increased expenditure. **Source:** [Economic Times](https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/power/cerc-says-solar-safeguard-duty-is-change-in-law-allows-compensation-for-acme/69200597) **In detail:** [CERC Order](http://www.cercind.gov.in/2019/orders/342&343-MP-2018.pdf)

The CERC ruled in favor of three independent power producers, who sought a release from paying their performance bank guarantee to the tune of $3.7 million, and to extend and defer the schedule commissioning date of two solar projects at the Bhadla Solar Park in Rajasthan. **Source:** [Mercom](https://mercomindia.com/cerc-ntpc-bhadla-solar-park/) **In detail:** [CERC Order](http://www.cercind.gov.in/2019/orders/340-MP-2018.pdf)

The Ministry of New and Renewable Energy held discussions with state governments to find out how much land states would be willing to set aside for renewable energy parks, following a recent announcement by the ministry that it will ensure that land and transmission facilities are in place for developers who win wind and solar projects in auctions conducted by the Solar Energy Corporation of India. **Source:** [Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/mnre-wants-states-to-identify-land-for-green-power-projects/articleshow/69298518.cms)

Despite four extensions to the bidding deadline, a solar tender for one gigawatt or solar power has yet again failed to attract developers, prompting only two bids for a total 300 megwatts (MW) of capacity.
