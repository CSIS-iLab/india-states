Significant state-level reforms continued at a slow pace in the fourth quarter of 2021. This was likely due to a mixture of pending elections in six states and the continued effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.   
   
Goa is the only state with a pending election that made significant improvements to its business environment. Punjab took a step in the wrong direction, passing legislation to revoke two contracts with private power firms.   
   
Still, across India, we witnessed fifteen reforms that should provide a stimulus to business growth and job creation. Throughout the last two years, states continue to move ahead on policies that look toward the future, trying to capitalize on sunrise industries. For instance, Himachal Pradesh and Odisha released policies aimed at expanding the EV market, and both Tripura and Tamil Nadu released policies to attract data center investments. The timing of these last two policies will likely be aided by the union finance minister’s budget announcement on February 1, where data centers will be granted infrastructure status.   
   
During the quarter, Odisha led the way with three positive business reforms. Goa, Tamil Nadu, and Haryana each had two significant reforms. Five other states had at least one reform that should help industrial growth during the period.
