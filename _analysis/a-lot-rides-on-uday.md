excerpt: "The central government has a limited set of tools to reform India’s broken state electricity utilities. But, fixing these utilities will help the states get their finances in order, reduce barriers to meeting India’s own renewable energy targets, and give a real boost to “Make in India.” With more than half of Indian states signed up to join the UDAY scheme, we can expect a solid short-term return, though ultimately state leaders will need to decide if this is a real turning point in how they manage their power grids."

In November 2015, Minister for Power Piyush Goyal announced a new program to bail out India’s struggling electricity utility companies, the <a href="http://bit.ly/28UCBJX">Ujwal DISCOM Assurance Yojana&nbsp;(UDAY)</a>. Weakness in the electric power sector remains one of India’s biggest obstacles to faster human and economic development. UDAY is not the first attempt to bail out the struggling state electricity utilities, but it has developed fairly strong momentum, and it has crucial features in terms of timing and commitments that make it qualitatively different from past bailouts. UDAY’s success is critical for India’s attempt to expand electricity access and for “Make in India.” Perhaps most notably for the Obama administration, UDAY can provide fiscal space for India to meet its significant clean energy commitments.
