**Indian states prepare for a post-pandemic world without improving the readiness for future waves**

Following on the heels of [declining](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/indias-covid-19-cases-have-declined-rapidly-herd-immunity-still-far-away-scientists-say__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1olxbTws0$) Covid-19 cases and [promising news](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.theguardian.com/world/2020/nov/09/covid-19-vaccine-candidate-effective-pfizer-biontech__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1ouiuKNlY$) about the vaccine, Indian states exhibited urgency in liberalizing business activity in the fourth quarter of 2020. States rushed to soften policies on land, labor, and liquidity, with little focus on strengthening public health safeguards. Of the 27 positive state-level reforms that [CSIS tracked](https://indianstates.csis.org/analysis/) in the fourth quarter, only [one](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.telegraphindia.com/jharkhand/jharkhand-notifies-workplace-policy-on-tuberculosis/cid/1801549__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1oaefdW-4$) prioritized health. Seven states introduced processes to fast-track investments, three states relaxed labor laws, two states announced multiple incentives for micro and small-scale enterprises (MSME), and three states eased conversion of land use.

If not pandemic resilience, green recovery took prominence in the Indian states’ policy discourse. Eight states announced sustainable measures, including building grid resilience, ramping energy efficiency, accelerating electric mobility, and clean-energy generation. Thus, in the fourth quarter, states were preparing for a post-pandemic world without improving the readiness for a future Covid-19 wave.

**On the path to economic recovery**

To induce new investments and steer the economy back to normal, states used a range of policy levers to improve the business environment. While Assam and Karnataka eased statutory clearances required for setting up businesses, Kerala, Punjab, and Rajasthan set up a single-window clearance system. The MSME sector received a boost of specifically targeted incentives from Odisha and Tamil Nadu. The states continued to revamp land and labor laws to provide a fillip to local entrepreneurs. Gujarat relaxed its labor laws and Odisha extended labor working hours for women. Further, Punjab and Gujarat permitted industrial development in agricultural land.

Some states chose to accelerate the adoption of an inclusive and sustainable path to economic recovery. For instance, Andhra Pradesh and Haryana introduced water conservation measures. Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan announced policies to encourage generation from clean energy sources. Uttar Pradesh launched a unique peer-to-peer trading platform for rooftop solar power. Andhra Pradesh kicked its energy efficiency efforts into high gear by setting up a committee of high-street banks to encourage investments within the sector. On the other hand, Telangana chose to strengthen its electricity grid and issued regulations on smart grid and [demand-side management](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/mercomindia.com/telangana-framework-demand-side-management/__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1oGKESD-E$). Covid–19 had a profound and protracted [impact](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/covid-impact-women-workforce-disappearing-most-affected-in-urban-india-120121500259_1.html__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1oJVn5oAI$) on India’s women workforce. In response, Punjab, Haryana, and Telangana introduced reservations for women to counter a disproportional trend in gender equality.

**Myopic approach**

While the central government’s new agriculture reforms are a [necessity](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/thediplomat.com/2020/12/indias-new-farm-laws-reform-resistance-and-the-road-to-reconciliation/__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1oCalvJ2A$) for the Indian farmers, the government has done little to rally support from the states. The reforms remained unwelcomed among the states. Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, and Kerala passed bills to bypass the farm laws. Similarly, the central government’s proposed electricity reforms ran into [opposition](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.newindianexpress.com/business/2020/jul/09/11-states-1-ut-oppose-electricity-amendment-bill-2020-says-aipef-2167546.html__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1omNkgy94$). Uttar Pradesh rolled back its decision to privatize one of its power distribution companies (discom). Moreover, Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand rejected a hike in electricity tariff. The gap between cost of supply and the average revenue realized by the discoms in both the states [remains high](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/nipfp.org.in/media/medialibrary/2021/03/WP_333_2021.pdf__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1o-g5imUc$). The lack of tariff rationalization will [precipitate](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/ieefa.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/The-Curious-Case-of-Indias-Discoms_August-2020.pdf__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1oYKmCBpc$) the dire financial health of states’ discoms.

States were aggressive in acting on routine short-sighted measures, and cautious in urging long-term sweeping reforms. The near absence of health reforms also reflects the myopic approach of states to building pandemic resilience. [Strengthening](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.livemint.com/news/india/covid-19-what-india-learnt-about-health-emergency-preparedness-11605091269629.html__;!!KRhing!PRalafdKV2hs6QYOkh0mg6S5r6oGABTK158KrRQ9g02LZGGjPk1oC1XuiDA$) the response of states to health emergencies will be crucial to ensure that states accept pandemic-driven changes without risking a backslide. As the states prepare to look forward, the coordination and resource provision from the central government will prove essential.
