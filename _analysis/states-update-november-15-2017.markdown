Moving a step closer towards major labor reform, a cabinet sub-committee has cleared a proposed change to the Industrial Disputes Act to allow businesses with less than 300 workers to shut down or lay off workers without seeking government permission. Currently, only units with less than 100 workers are exempt from the requirement. The change would mean that 96 percent of the state&#39;s industrial units would be covered by the waiver, compared to 87 percent currently. If enacted, Maharashtra would become the fourth state to make the change. **Source:** [Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/state-to-make-closure-easier-for-factories/articleshow/61601005.cms) **In Detail:** [Breakthrough Index - Labor Reform](https://www.csis.org/analysis/wadhwaninathan-breakthrough-index-labor-reform)
