Maharashtra orders five entities to comply with their solar and non-solar renewable purchase obligation requirements; Tamil Nadu bans the State Load Dispatch Center from curtailing solar power at its convenience; Bihar keeps solar power tariffs unchanged from 2018-2019; Jammu and Kashmir bans civilian traffic on the Jammu-Srinagar highway on Sundays and Wednesdays; report finds that India's central and state governments cancelled 5,300 MW of valid winning power project bids in 2018 due to high bid rates; and more.

**Center – State relations**

According to a report by a consulting group Bridge to India, India's central and state government canceled 5,300 megawatts (MW) of valid winning bids in 2018 due to high bid rates. The cancelation of such auctions for renewable energy projects has saved central and state governments $490 billion, although companies have sharply criticized the practice as anti-investor. **Source:** [Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/energy/power/scrapping-renewable-energy-projects-saved-rs-3400-cr-mnre-secretary/articleshow/68714627.cms) **In detail:** [India RE Outlook 2019](https://bridgetoindia.com/report/india-re-outlook-2019-i-january-2019/)
