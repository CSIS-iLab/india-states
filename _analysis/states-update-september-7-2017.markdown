If liabilities related to state assumption of power debt are excluded, the deficit still reached 3.32 percent in the past fiscal year. **Source:** [Business Standard ](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/state-finances-are-showing-signs-of-increasing-fiscal-imbalance-117090400003_1.html)**In Detail:** [NIPFP Policy Brief on State Finances](http://www.nipfp.org.in/media/medialibrary/2017/08/Seminar_papers.pdf)

**Madhya Pradesh**

Madhya Pradesh government launched a new program to combat price risks in agriculture by compensating farmers for distress sales below the national minimum support price (MSP).

The scheme will begin by covering eight crops, mostly oilseeds and pulses, where government  procurement is typically low. **Source:** [Livemint](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/uDdclMv4VKUhGvpSEqtmqL/Madhya-Pradesh-launches-new-farm-scheme-to-hedge-price-risks.html)
